Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `nums` should be generated to test the API method, which represents ordering an array of integers based on the sum of their digits. The sign of the integer is considered in the sum of its digits. 

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.

Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `nums`:

- class:
    1. `nums`: is null
- class:
    1. `nums`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains only positive single-digit numbers
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains only negative single-digit numbers
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains both positive and negative single-digit numbers
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains only positive multi-digit numbers
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains only negative multi-digit numbers
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains both positive and negative multi-digit numbers
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains both single-digit and multi-digit numbers, with some having the same digit sum
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains numbers with the same digit sum but different signs (e.g., -10 and 10, which both have a digit sum of 1)

These classes will help ensure that the method handles various scenarios correctly, including edge cases such as null and empty input, as well as different combinations of positive and negative numbers with varying digit sums.
