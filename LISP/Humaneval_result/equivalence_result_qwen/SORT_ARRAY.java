Certainly! Let's analyze the `sort_array` method and partition the input equivalence classes for the `array` parameter.

The method performs the following operations:
1. Checks if the array length is zero, and returns the array immediately if so.
2. Sorts the array using `Arrays.sort()`.
3. Checks if the sum of the first and last elements of the sorted array is odd. If it is, the method returns the sorted array.
4. If the sum of the first and last elements is even, the method reverses the sorted array and returns it.

Based on these operations, we can partition the input equivalence classes as follows:

- class:
  1. `array`: is an empty array (`array.length == 0`)

- class:
  1. `array`: has one element (`array.length == 1`)
  
- class:
  1. `array`: has multiple elements, and after sorting, the sum of the first and last elements is odd

- class:
  1. `array`: has multiple elements, and after sorting, the sum of the first and last elements is even

Let's elaborate on these classes:

- class:
  1. `array`: is an empty array (`array.length == 0`)
  - Example: `new int[] {}`

- class:
  1. `array`: has one element (`array.length == 1`)
  - Example: `new int[] {5}`

- class:
  1. `array`: has multiple elements, and after sorting, the sum of the first and last elements is odd
  - Example: `new int[] {2, 3, 1}` (sorted: `{1, 2, 3}`, sum of first and last: `1 + 3 = 4` (even), but let's choose another example: `new int[] {2, 3, 1, 4}` (sorted: `{1, 2, 3, 4}`, sum of first and last: `1 + 4 = 5` (odd))

- class:
  1. `array`: has multiple elements, and after sorting, the sum of the first and last elements is even
  - Example: `new int[] {2, 3, 1, 4, 6}` (sorted: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 6}`, sum of first and last: `1 + 6 = 7` (odd), but let's choose another example: `new int[] {2, 3, 1, 4, 5}` (sorted: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, sum of first and last: `1 + 5 = 6` (even))

These partitions ensure that all possible scenarios are covered, including edge cases and typical cases.
