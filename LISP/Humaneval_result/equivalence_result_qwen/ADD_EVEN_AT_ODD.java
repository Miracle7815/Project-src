Sure, let's analyze the `add_even_at_odd` method and partition the equivalence classes for the input array `lst`.

The method iterates through the array starting from index 1 (the second element) and increments by 2, checking if the element at each odd index is even. If it is, it adds that element to the sum.

Here are the equivalence classes for the input array `lst`:

- class:
    1. `lst`: is null
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `lst`: has only one element
- class:
    1. `lst`: has multiple elements, all elements at odd indices are odd
- class:
    1. `lst`: has multiple elements, some elements at odd indices are even
- class:
    1. `lst`: has multiple elements, all elements at odd indices are even

Let's elaborate on these classes:

- class:
    1. `lst`: is null
    - This tests the scenario where the input array is null.
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty array
    - This tests the scenario where the input array is empty.
- class:
    1. `lst`: has only one element
    - This tests the scenario where there are no odd indices to check.
- class:
    1. `lst`: has multiple elements, all elements at odd indices are odd
    - This tests the scenario where none of the elements at odd indices are even.
- class:
    1. `lst`: has multiple elements, some elements at odd indices are even
    - This tests the scenario where some of the elements at odd indices are even.
- class:
    1. `lst`: has multiple elements, all elements at odd indices are even
    - This tests the scenario where all of the elements at odd indices are even.

These partitions help ensure that we cover a variety of cases for the input array `lst`.
