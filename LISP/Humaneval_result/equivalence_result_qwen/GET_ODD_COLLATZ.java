Certainly! Let's partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `n` in the `get_odd_collatz` method.

### Equivalence Classes for `n`:

1. **Class:**
   - `n`: is less than 1 (invalid input as per the Collatz conjecture, which starts with positive integers)
   
2. **Class:**
   - `n`: is equal to 1
   
3. **Class:**
   - `n`: is an even number greater than 1
   
4. **Class:**
   - `n`: is an odd number greater than 1

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Class: `n` is less than 1**
  - Description: This tests the behavior of the function when given an invalid input according to the problem constraints (Collatz sequence starts with positive integers).
  - Example: `n = 0`, `n = -5`

- **Class: `n` is equal to 1**
  - Description: This tests the base case of the Collatz sequence where `n` is 1.
  - Example: `n = 1`

- **Class: `n` is an even number greater than 1**
  - Description: This tests the function with even numbers, which will be divided by 2 in the sequence.
  - Example: `n = 2`, `n = 10`, `n = 100`

- **Class: `n` is an odd number greater than 1**
  - Description: This tests the function with odd numbers, which will be transformed to `3 * n + 1` in the sequence.
  - Example: `n = 3`, `n = 7`, `n = 99`

These equivalence classes cover the different scenarios that the `get_odd_collatz` method might encounter, ensuring that all branches of the logic are tested.
