Certainly! Let's break down the input space for the method `fizz_buzz(int n)` and partition it into equivalence classes based on the behavior of the method.

### Analysis
- The method iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each number `i` in this range, it checks if `i` is divisible by `11` or `13`.
- If `i` is divisible by `11` or `13`, it then checks each digit of `i` to see if it contains the digit `'7'`.
- If a digit `'7'` is found, it increments the `result`.

### Equivalence Classes
We can partition the input space based on the value of `n` and the presence of numbers divisible by `11` or `13` that contain the digit `'7'`.

1. **Class: `n` is less than 0**
   - Description: Negative values for `n` are not typical for loop ranges.
   - Form: `n < 0`
   
2. **Class: `n` is 0**
   - Description: No iterations occur.
   - Form: `n == 0`
   
3. **Class: `n` is 1**
   - Description: Only one iteration occurs, but no numbers divisible by `11` or `13` are present.
   - Form: `n == 1`
   
4. **Class: `n` is between 1 and 10 (inclusive)**
   - Description: Multiple iterations occur, but no numbers divisible by `11` or `13` are present.
   - Form: `1 <= n <= 10`
   
5. **Class: `n` is greater than 10 and includes numbers divisible by 11 or 13 but none of these numbers contain the digit '7'**
   - Description: Numbers like `11`, `13`, `22`, etc., are present but do not contain the digit `'7'`.
   - Form: `n > 10` and no `i` such that `(i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0)` and `i` contains `'7'`
   
6. **Class: `n` is greater than 10 and includes numbers divisible by 11 or 13 that also contain the digit '7'**
   - Description: Numbers like `77`, `143`, `154`, etc., are present and contain the digit `'7'`.
   - Form: `n > 10` and there exists `i` such that `(i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0)` and `i` contains `'7'`

### Summary
```markdown
- class: n < 0
- class: n == 0
- class: n == 1
- class: 1 <= n <= 10
- class: n > 10 and no i such that (i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0) and i contains '7'
- class: n > 10 and there exists i such that (i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0) and i contains '7'
```

These equivalence classes cover the different scenarios that the method might encounter, ensuring comprehensive testing.
