Based on the provided Java code, we will partition the equivalence classes for the `match_parens` method. This method takes an array of two strings (`lst`) and checks if either concatenation of the strings results in a balanced parentheses string.

Let's define the equivalence classes:

- class:
    1. `lst`: is null
- class:
    1. `lst`: length is not equal to 2
- class:
    1. `lst`: length is 2, both strings are empty
- class:
    1. `lst`: length is 2, one string is empty, the other string contains only balanced parentheses
- class:
    1. `lst`: length is 2, one string is empty, the other string contains unbalanced parentheses
- class:
    1. `lst`: length is 2, both strings contain only balanced parentheses and their concatenation is balanced
- class:
    1. `lst`: length is 2, both strings contain only balanced parentheses but their concatenation is unbalanced
- class:
    1. `lst`: length is 2, one string contains balanced parentheses, the other string contains unbalanced parentheses
- class:
    1. `lst`: length is 2, both strings contain unbalanced parentheses
- class:
    1. `lst`: length is 2, both strings contain only unbalanced parentheses but their concatenation is balanced

These partitions ensure we cover all possible scenarios for the input array `lst` and how the method handles different combinations of balanced and unbalanced parentheses strings.
