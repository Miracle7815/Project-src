Sure, let's break down the input space for the `string_sequence` method:

The method `string_sequence` takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string containing numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

We can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `n` as follows:

- class:
  1. `n`: is less than 0 (negative numbers)
- class:
  1. `n`: is equal to 0
- class:
  1. `n`: is a positive integer greater than 0

These partitions cover all possible values of `n` and ensure that we test the behavior of the method with negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers. Here is how each case behaves:

1. If `n` is less than 0, the loop condition `i <= n` will never be true (since `i` starts at 0 and only increments), so the `result` string will remain empty, and after trimming, it will still be an empty string.
2. If `n` is equal to 0, the loop will run once with `i` equal to 0, appending "0 " to the `result` string, which will then be trimmed to "0".
3. If `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, the loop will run from 0 to `n`, appending each number followed by a space to the `result` string. After trimming, the trailing space will be removed, resulting in a string of numbers from 0 to `n` separated by spaces.

This ensures comprehensive testing of the `string_sequence` method.
