Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `file_name` should be generated to test the API method, which represents whether or not the file name meets specific criteria.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `file_name`:

- class:
    1. `file_name`: is null
- class:
    1. `file_name`: does not contain exactly one dot (".")
- class:
    1. `file_name`: the extension after the dot is not "txt", "exe", or "dll"
- class:
    1. `file_name`: the name before the dot is empty
- class:
    1. `file_name`: the first character of the name before the dot is not a letter
- class:
    1. `file_name`: the name contains more than three digits
- class:
    1. `file_name`: the name contains exactly one dot (".")
    2. The extension after the dot is "txt", "exe", or "dll"
    3. The name before the dot is not empty
    4. The first character of the name before the dot is a letter
    5. The name contains zero, one, two, or three digits

These classes cover all possible conditions that could lead to the method returning either "Yes" or "No".
