Based on the method signature and body, the instance of `number` should be generated to test the API method, which converts an integer to a mini Roman numeral representation. To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.

Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `number`:

- class:
    1. `number`: is less than 1 (minimum valid input is 1)
- class:
    1. `number`: is exactly 1 (minimum valid input)
- class:
    1. `number`: is a value that can be represented by a single Roman numeral symbol (e.g., 4, 5, 9, 10, etc.)
- class:
    1. `number`: is a value that can be represented by a combination of Roman numeral symbols (e.g., 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, etc.)
- class:
    1. `number`: is a value that includes subtractive combinations (e.g., 4, 9, 40, 90, 400, 900)
- class:
    1. `number`: is a large value that requires multiple symbols (e.g., 1000, 1500, 2000, etc.)
- class:
    1. `number`: is the maximum possible integer value that can be represented by the given Roman numeral system (typically 3999)

Note: The method does not handle numbers greater than 3999, so there is no need to test values beyond this point. Also, since the method does not handle negative numbers or zero, those are also not valid inputs.
