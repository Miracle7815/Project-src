Sure, let's analyze the method and partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `n`.

The method `make_a_pile` generates an `ArrayList<Integer>` containing `n` elements, where each element is calculated as `n + 2 * i` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. 

Here are the equivalence classes for the input parameter `n`:

- class:
  1. `n`: is less than 0 (invalid input, since the length of an ArrayList cannot be negative)
- class:
  1. `n`: is equal to 0 (edge case, should return an empty ArrayList)
- class:
  1. `n`: is equal to 1 (simple case, should return an ArrayList with one element)
- class:
  1. `n`: is greater than 1 (normal cases, should return an ArrayList with `n` elements)

These partitions cover the basic scenarios, edge cases, and typical use cases for the method.
