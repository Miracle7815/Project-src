Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `s` and `c` should be generated to test the API method, which removes all characters in string `s` that appear in string `c` and then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `s` and `c`:

- class:
    1. `s`: is null; 2. `c`: can be any string
- class:
    1. `s`: is an empty string; 2. `c`: can be any string
- class:
    1. `s`: is a non-empty string; 2. `c`: is null
- class:
    1. `s`: is a non-empty string; 2. `c`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `s`: is a string that contains characters from `c`; 2. `c`: is a string that contains characters present in `s`
- class:
    1. `s`: is a string that does not contain any characters from `c`; 2. `c`: is a string that does not contain characters present in `s`
- class:
    1. `s`: is a string that becomes a palindrome after removing characters from `c`; 2. `c`: is a string that contains characters present in `s`
- class:
    1. `s`: is a string that does not become a palindrome after removing characters from `c`; 2. `c`: is a string that contains characters present in `s`
