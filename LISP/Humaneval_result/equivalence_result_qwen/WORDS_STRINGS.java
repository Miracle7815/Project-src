Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `s` should be generated to test the API method, which splits a string into words, treating commas as spaces and ignoring multiple spaces.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.

Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `s`:

- class:
    1. `s`: is null
- class:
    1. `s`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `s`: contains only spaces
- class:
    1. `s`: contains only commas
- class:
    1. `s`: contains a mix of characters, spaces, and commas, but no consecutive spaces or commas
- class:
    1. `s`: contains a mix of characters, spaces, and commas, with consecutive spaces
- class:
    1. `s`: contains a mix of characters, spaces, and commas, with consecutive commas
- class:
    1. `s`: contains a mix of characters, spaces, and commas, with both consecutive spaces and commas
