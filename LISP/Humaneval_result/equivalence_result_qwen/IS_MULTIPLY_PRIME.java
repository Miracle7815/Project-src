Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `a` should be generated to test the API method, which represents whether or not the given integer can be expressed as a product of three prime numbers.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.

Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `a`:

- class:
  1. `a`: is less than 2 (since there are no primes less than 2)

- class:
  1. `a`: is a prime number itself (since a prime number cannot be expressed as a product of three prime numbers)

- class:
  1. `a`: can be expressed as a product of exactly three prime numbers (e.g., 30 = 2 * 3 * 5)

- class:
  1. `a`: can be expressed as a product of more than three prime numbers (e.g., 60 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5)

- class:
  1. `a`: can be expressed as a product of three prime numbers but includes duplicates (e.g., 8 = 2 * 2 * 2, but the method checks for distinct primes)

- class:
  1. `a`: cannot be expressed as a product of three prime numbers (e.g., 49 = 7 * 7)

Note: Since the method does not check for distinct primes, classes 4 and 5 are actually covered by class 3 and class 6, respectively. However, it is good to consider these cases to ensure robustness. 

So, the simplified classes are:

- class:
  1. `a`: is less than 2

- class:
  1. `a`: is a prime number itself

- class:
  1. `a`: can be expressed as a product of exactly three prime numbers

- class:
  1. `a`: cannot be expressed as a product of three prime numbers
