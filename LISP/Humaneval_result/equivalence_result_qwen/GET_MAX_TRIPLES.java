Based on the method signature and body, the instance of `n` should be generated to test the API method, which represents the size of the array `A` and the number of iterations for finding triples whose sum is divisible by 3.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches and handle various edge cases in the Method Body.

Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `n`:

- class:
    1. `n`: is less than 3 (e.g., 0, 1, 2). In this case, the nested loops will not execute because there aren't enough elements to form a triple.
- class:
    1. `n`: is equal to 3. This is the smallest value where a triple can be formed.
- class:
    1. `n`: is greater than 3 and even (e.g., 4, 6, 8). This covers scenarios where the array size is even.
- class:
    1. `n`: is greater than 3 and odd (e.g., 5, 7, 9). This covers scenarios where the array size is odd.
- class:
    1. `n`: is a large value (e.g., 100, 1000). This tests the performance and correctness of the method with a large input size.
