Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `brackets` should be generated to test the API method, which represents whether or not there are at least two properly nested bracket pairs in the string.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `brackets`:

- class:
    1. `brackets`: is null
- class:
    1. `brackets`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `brackets`: contains no brackets
- class:
    1. `brackets`: contains only opening brackets
- class:
    1. `brackets`: contains only closing brackets
- class:
    1. `brackets`: contains one properly nested bracket pair
- class:
    1. `brackets`: contains exactly two properly nested bracket pairs
- class:
    1. `brackets`: contains more than two properly nested bracket pairs
- class:
    1. `brackets`: contains improperly nested brackets (e.g., "][")
- class:
    1. `brackets`: contains mixed characters (not just brackets) with at least two properly nested bracket pairs
- class:
    1. `brackets`: contains mixed characters (not just brackets) with less than two properly nested bracket pairs

These classes cover various scenarios including edge cases, normal cases, and abnormal cases.
