Based on the method signature and body, the instance of `n` should be generated to test the API method, which calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to `n` using the formula `(n + 1) * n / 2`. To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.

However, since this method is a simple mathematical calculation, the main focus would be on testing edge cases and ensuring the formula works correctly for various inputs. We can partition the following equivalence classes for `n`:

- class:
    1. `n`: is 0 (edge case where the sum should be 0)
- class:
    1. `n`: is 1 (base case where the sum should be 1)
- class:
    1. `n`: is a positive integer greater than 1 (e.g., 5, 10, 100)
- class:
    1. `n`: is a large positive integer close to the maximum value of an integer (e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1) to check for overflow issues
- class:
    1. `n`: is a negative integer (e.g., -1, -5, -10) to check how the function handles invalid input

Note that Java's integer division will automatically floor the result, so there's no need to separately consider fractional results. Also, since the formula `(n + 1) * n / 2` assumes `n` is a non-negative integer, the behavior for negative values of `n` is undefined in the context of summing integers from 1 to `n`. However, it's still important to test these cases to see how the function behaves.
