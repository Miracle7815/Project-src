Certainly! Based on the provided method, we need to consider various scenarios for the input parameters `string` and `substring` to ensure we cover all possible edge cases and typical use cases.

Here are the equivalence classes:

- class:
    1. `string`: is null; 2. `substring`: can be any string
- class:
    1. `string`: is an empty string; 2. `substring`: can be any string
- class:
    1. `string`: can be any string; 2. `substring`: is null
- class:
    1. `string`: can be any string; 2. `substring`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `string`: contains the `substring` once; 2. `substring`: is a non-empty string
- class:
    1. `string`: contains the `substring` multiple times; 2. `substring`: is a non-empty string
- class:
    1. `string`: does not contain the `substring`; 2. `substring`: is a non-empty string
- class:
    1. `string`: is the same as `substring`; 2. `substring`: is a non-empty string
- class:
    1. `string`: contains overlapping occurrences of `substring`; 2. `substring`: is a non-empty string

These equivalence classes will help us ensure that the method is thoroughly tested under various conditions.
