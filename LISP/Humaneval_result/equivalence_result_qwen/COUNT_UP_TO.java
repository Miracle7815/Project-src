Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `n` should be generated to test the API method, which returns a list of prime numbers up to but not including `n`.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `n`:

- class:
    1. `n`: less than 2 (e.g., 0, 1, -5)
- class:
    2. `n`: equal to 2
- class:
    3. `n`: greater than 2 and has no prime numbers in the range (e.g., 4, 6, 8)
- class:
    4. `n`: greater than 2 and has some prime numbers in the range (e.g., 10, 20, 30)
- class:
    5. `n`: very large positive integer (to test performance and edge cases)

These classes cover scenarios where the input `n` is less than the smallest prime number, exactly the smallest prime number, includes no prime numbers in the range, includes some prime numbers, and tests the performance with a large input.
