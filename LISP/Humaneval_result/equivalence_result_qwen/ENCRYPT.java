Certainly! Let's analyze the `encrypt` method and partition the equivalence classes for the input string `s`.

### Method Analysis:
The `encrypt` method takes a string `s` and shifts each lowercase letter in the string by 4 positions forward in the alphabet (wrapping around if necessary). Non-lowercase characters are appended to the result string unchanged.

### Equivalence Classes:
1. **Null Input:**
   - `s`: null
2. **Empty String:**
   - `s`: ""
3. **String with Only Lowercase Letters:**
   - `s`: "abc" (no wrap-around)
   - `s`: "xyz" (with wrap-around)
4. **String with Mixed Case Letters:**
   - `s`: "Abc"
   - `s`: "aBc"
   - `s`: "ABC"
5. **String with Non-Lowercase Characters:**
   - `s`: "abc123"
   - `s`: "abc!@#"
6. **String with All Non-Lowercase Characters:**
   - `s`: "123"
   - `s`: "!@#"

### Partitioning:
- class: `s` is null
- class: `s` is an empty string
- class: `s` contains only lowercase letters with no wrap-around
- class: `s` contains only lowercase letters with wrap-around
- class: `s` contains mixed case letters
- class: `s` contains lowercase letters and non-lowercase characters
- class: `s` contains only non-lowercase characters

### Detailed Form:
- class: `s` is null
- class: `s` is an empty string
- class: `s` contains only lowercase letters with no wrap-around (e.g., "abc")
- class: `s` contains only lowercase letters with wrap-around (e.g., "xyz")
- class: `s` contains mixed case letters (e.g., "Abc", "aBc", "ABC")
- class: `s` contains lowercase letters and non-lowercase characters (e.g., "abc123", "abc!@#")
- class: `s` contains only non-lowercase characters (e.g., "123", "!@#")

These partitions help ensure that all possible scenarios are tested, including edge cases and typical use cases.
