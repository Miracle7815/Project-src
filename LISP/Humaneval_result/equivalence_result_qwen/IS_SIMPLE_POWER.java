Sure, let's break down the possible equivalence classes for the parameters `x` and `n` in the `is_simple_power` method.

The method checks if `x` is a simple power of `n`, meaning there exists some integer `k` such that `n^k = x`. Here are the equivalence classes:

- class:
  1. `x`: is less than 1; 2. `n`: can be any integer
- class:
  1. `x`: is 1; 2. `n`: is 1
- class:
  1. `x`: is 1; 2. `n`: is greater than 1
- class:
  1. `x`: is greater than 1; 2. `n`: is less than 1
- class:
  1. `x`: is greater than 1; 2. `n`: is 1
- class:
  1. `x`: is a power of `n`; 2. `n`: is greater than 1
- class:
  1. `x`: is not a power of `n`; 2. `n`: is greater than 1

This covers all possible scenarios for the values of `x` and `n` in the context of the `is_simple_power` method.
