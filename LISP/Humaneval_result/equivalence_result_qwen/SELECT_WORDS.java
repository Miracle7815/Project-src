Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `s` and `n` should be generated to test the API method, which represents selecting words from a string based on the number of consonants they contain.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `s` and `n`:

- class:
    1. `s`: is null; 2. `n`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `s`: is an empty string; 2. `n`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `s`: contains only spaces; 2. `n`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `s`: contains words with no consonants; 2. `n`: is 0
- class:
    1. `s`: contains words with no consonants; 2. `n`: is greater than 0
- class:
    1. `s`: contains words with only consonants; 2. `n`: is equal to the length of the word
- class:
    1. `s`: contains words with only consonants; 2. `n`: is less than the length of the word
- class:
    1. `s`: contains words with mixed characters; 2. `n`: is equal to the number of consonants in some words
- class:
    1. `s`: contains words with mixed characters; 2. `n`: is not equal to the number of consonants in any word
- class:
    1. `s`: contains multiple words with the same number of consonants; 2. `n`: is equal to the number of consonants in those words
- class:
    1. `s`: contains words with special characters or numbers; 2. `n`: can be any integer

These partitions ensure that various scenarios are tested, including edge cases and typical use cases.
