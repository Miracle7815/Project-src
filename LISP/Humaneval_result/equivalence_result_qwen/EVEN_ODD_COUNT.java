Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `num` should be generated to test the API method, which counts the number of even and odd digits in a given integer.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `num`:

- class:
    1. `num`: is zero
- class:
    1. `num`: is a positive single-digit even number
- class:
    1. `num`: is a positive single-digit odd number
- class:
    1. `num`: is a positive multi-digit number with both even and odd digits
- class:
    1. `num`: is a positive multi-digit number with only even digits
- class:
    1. `num`: is a positive multi-digit number with only odd digits
- class:
    1. `num`: is a negative single-digit even number
- class:
    1. `num`: is a negative single-digit odd number
- class:
    1. `num`: is a negative multi-digit number with both even and odd digits
- class:
    1. `num`: is a negative multi-digit number with only even digits
- class:
    1. `num`: is a negative multi-digit number with only odd digits

These classes cover various scenarios including positive and negative numbers, single and multi-digit numbers, and combinations of even and odd digits.
