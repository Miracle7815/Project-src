Sure, let's break down the method `prime_fib(int n)` and partition the equivalence classes for the input `n`.

### Method Analysis:
- The method `prime_fib(int n)` returns the nth prime Fibonacci number.
- It uses an `ArrayList` to generate Fibonacci numbers.
- It checks if each Fibonacci number is prime using the `is_prime(int n)` method.
- It continues generating Fibonacci numbers until it finds the nth prime Fibonacci number.

### Equivalence Classes for `n`:

1. **Invalid Input (Negative Numbers and Zero):**
   - class:
       1. `n`: less than 1 (negative numbers and zero)

2. **Valid Input (Positive Numbers):**
   - class:
       1. `n`: equal to 1 (first prime Fibonacci number)
   - class:
       1. `n`: greater than 1 (subsequent prime Fibonacci numbers)

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Invalid Input (Negative Numbers and Zero):**
   - This class includes all non-positive integers. Since the problem statement implies finding the nth prime Fibonacci number, negative numbers and zero do not make sense in this context.
   - Example values: -5, -1, 0

2. **Valid Input (Positive Numbers):**
   - This class includes all positive integers.
   - Subclass for `n` equal to 1:
       - class:
           1. `n`: equal to 1 (first prime Fibonacci number)
       - Example value: 1
   - Subclass for `n` greater than 1:
       - class:
           1. `n`: greater than 1 (subsequent prime Fibonacci numbers)
       - Example values: 2, 3, 4, 5, ...

By testing these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the method handles invalid inputs gracefully and correctly identifies the nth prime Fibonacci number for valid inputs.
