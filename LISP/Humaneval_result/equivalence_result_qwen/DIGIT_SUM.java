Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `s` should be generated to test the API method, which calculates the sum of ASCII values of uppercase letters in a given string.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `s`:

- class:
  1. `s`: is null
- class:
  1. `s`: is an empty string
- class:
  1. `s`: contains only lowercase letters and/or numbers
- class:
  1. `s`: contains only uppercase letters
- class:
  1. `s`: contains a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and/or numbers
- class:
  1. `s`: contains special characters and/or whitespace
- class:
  1. `s`: contains a mix of all the above categories

These partitions ensure that the method is tested under various scenarios, including edge cases and typical use cases.
