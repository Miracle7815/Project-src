Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `sentence` should be generated to test the API method, which represents filtering words in a sentence based on their length and divisibility.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `sentence`:

- class:
  1. `sentence`: is null
- class:
  1. `sentence`: is an empty string
- class:
  1. `sentence`: contains only one word with length 1
- class:
  1. `sentence`: contains only one word with length 2
- class:
  1. `sentence`: contains only one word with prime length (e.g., 3, 5, 7, ...)
- class:
  1. `sentence`: contains only one word with non-prime length greater than 2 (e.g., 4, 6, 8, ...)
- class:
  1. `sentence`: contains multiple words with various lengths, including all cases mentioned above

These partitions ensure that we cover scenarios where the sentence might be null, empty, or contain words of different lengths and divisibility characteristics.
