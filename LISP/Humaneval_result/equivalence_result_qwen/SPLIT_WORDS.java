Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `txt` should be generated to test the API method, which represents splitting a text into words based on spaces or commas, or counting lowercase letters at odd positions in the alphabet if neither delimiter is present.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `txt`:

- class:
    1. `txt`: is null
- class:
    1. `txt`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `txt`: contains only spaces
- class:
    1. `txt`: contains only commas
- class:
    1. `txt`: contains both spaces and commas
- class:
    1. `txt`: contains words separated by spaces (no commas)
- class:
    1. `txt`: contains words separated by commas (no spaces)
- class:
    1. `txt`: contains no spaces or commas, and no lowercase letters at odd positions in the alphabet
- class:
    1. `txt`: contains no spaces or commas, and some lowercase letters at odd positions in the alphabet
- class:
    1. `txt`: contains no spaces or commas, and all lowercase letters at odd positions in the alphabet
