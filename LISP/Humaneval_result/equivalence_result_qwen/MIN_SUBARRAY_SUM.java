Certainly! Based on the provided method `min_subarray_sum`, we need to generate test cases for the input parameter `nums`. The goal is to cover all possible scenarios that the method might encounter.

Here are the equivalence classes for `nums`:

- class:
    1. `nums`: is null
- class:
    1. `nums`: is an empty ArrayList
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains only one positive number
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains only one negative number
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains multiple positive numbers
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains multiple negative numbers
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains both positive and negative numbers, with a minimum subarray sum that includes both positive and negative numbers
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains both positive and negative numbers, with a minimum subarray sum that includes only negative numbers
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains both positive and negative numbers, with a minimum subarray sum that includes only positive numbers (this case is less likely but worth considering for completeness)

Each of these classes will help ensure that the method handles different types of input correctly.
