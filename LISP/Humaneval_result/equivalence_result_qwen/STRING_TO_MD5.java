Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `text` should be generated to test the API method, which represents converting a string to its MD5 hash.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `text`:

- class:
  1. `text`: is null
- class:
  1. `text`: is an empty string
- class:
  1. `text`: is a string with only whitespace characters (e.g., " ", "\t", "\n")
- class:
  1. `text`: is a string with a single character
- class:
  1. `text`: is a string with multiple identical characters (e.g., "aaaa", "1111")
- class:
  1. `text`: is a string with mixed case letters (e.g., "AbCdEfGh")
- class:
  1. `text`: is a string with special characters (e.g., "!@#$%^&*()")
- class:
  1. `text`: is a long string (e.g., a paragraph or more)
- class:
  1. `text`: is a string with non-ASCII characters (e.g., "こんにちは", "안녕하세요")

These classes cover a wide range of possible input scenarios, ensuring that the method is thoroughly tested.
