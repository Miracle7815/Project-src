Sure, let's break down the input parameters `n` and `m` for the `rounded_avg` method to identify the equivalence classes.

The method calculates the average of integers from `n` to `m` inclusive, rounds it, and returns the result as a binary string. Here are the equivalence classes:

- class:
  1. `n`: any integer; 2. `m`: any integer less than `n`
  - This will always return "-1" because `m` is less than `n`.

- class:
  1. `n`: any integer; 2. `m`: equals `n`
  - This will calculate the average of a single number, which is the number itself, and then return the binary representation of that number.

- class:
  1. `n`: any integer; 2. `m`: greater than `n`, results in an even number of integers in the range `[n, m]`
  - This will calculate the average of an even number of integers, round it, and return the binary representation.

- class:
  1. `n`: any integer; 2. `m`: greater than `n`, results in an odd number of integers in the range `[n, m]`
  - This will calculate the average of an odd number of integers, round it, and return the binary representation.

- class:
  1. `n`: a very large positive integer; 2. `m`: a very large positive integer, `m > n`
  - This will test the method's behavior with large ranges and ensure it handles large sums correctly.

- class:
  1. `n`: a very small negative integer; 2. `m`: a very small negative integer, `m > n`
  - This will test the method's behavior with negative ranges and ensure it handles negative sums correctly.

- class:
  1. `n`: a very small negative integer; 2. `m`: a very large positive integer
  - This will test the method's behavior with ranges that span both negative and positive numbers.

These classes should help cover a wide range of scenarios for the `rounded_avg` method.
