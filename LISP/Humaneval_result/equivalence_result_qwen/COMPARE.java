Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `game` and `guess` should be generated to test the API method, which calculates the absolute difference between corresponding elements of two integer arrays.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `game` and `guess`:

- class:
  1. `game`: is null; 2. `guess`: can be any array
- class:
  1. `guess`: is null; 2. `game`: can be any array
- class:
  1. `game`: is an empty array; 2. `guess`: is an empty array
- class:
  1. `game`: is an array with one element; 2. `guess`: is an array with one element
- class:
  1. `game`: is an array with multiple elements; 2. `guess`: is an array with the same length as `game`
- class:
  1. `game`: is an array with multiple elements; 2. `guess`: is an array with a different length than `game` (this will cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, so it might be better to exclude this case unless specifically testing for exceptions)

Note: The last class is not recommended for normal testing of the function since it will throw an exception. However, it could be useful for boundary testing or negative testing. 

So, we can exclude it from the main equivalence classes for testing the intended functionality.
