Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `brackets` should be generated to test the API method, which checks whether a string of angle brackets is correctly bracketed. To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.

Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `brackets`:

- class:
    1. `brackets`: is null
- class:
    1. `brackets`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `brackets`: contains only '<' characters, depth never goes negative but is not zero at the end
- class:
    1. `brackets`: contains only '>' characters, depth goes negative
- class:
    1. `brackets`: starts with '>', depth goes negative immediately
- class:
    1. `brackets`: ends with '<', depth is not zero at the end
- class:
    1. `brackets`: balanced with equal number of '<' and '>' characters, depth never goes negative and is zero at the end
- class:
    1. `brackets`: unbalanced with more '<' than '>' characters, depth is not zero at the end
- class:
    1. `brackets`: unbalanced with more '>' than '<' characters, depth goes negative at some point
- class:
    1. `brackets`: contains a mix of '<' and '>' characters that are correctly nested, depth never goes negative and is zero at the end
- class:
    1. `brackets`: contains a mix of '<' and '>' characters that are incorrectly nested, depth goes negative at some point
