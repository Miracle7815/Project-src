Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `numbers` should be generated to test the API method, which represents an operation to rescale an array of numbers to a unit scale (0-1).
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `numbers`:

- class:
    1. `numbers`: is null

- class:
    1. `numbers`: is an empty array

- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains only one element

- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains all identical elements

- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains both positive and negative elements, with distinct values

- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains only positive elements, with distinct values

- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains only negative elements, with distinct values

- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains a mix of very large and very small values

- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains values that can cause overflow or underflow when performing arithmetic operations (e.g., very large positive and very large negative numbers)

These partitions cover various scenarios that the `rescale_to_unit` method might encounter, ensuring thorough testing.
