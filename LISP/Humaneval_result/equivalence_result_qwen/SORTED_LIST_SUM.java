Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `lst` should be generated to test the API method, which filters and sorts a list of strings based on their lengths and lexicographical order.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `lst`:

- class:
    1. `lst`: is null
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only strings with odd lengths
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only strings with even lengths, all strings have the same length
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only strings with even lengths, strings have different lengths
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains both strings with even and odd lengths, strings with even lengths have the same length
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains both strings with even and odd lengths, strings with even lengths have different lengths
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains duplicate strings with even lengths, some strings have the same length, others have different lengths
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains duplicate strings with odd lengths, some strings have the same length, others have different lengths

These partitions cover various scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure comprehensive testing of the `sorted_list_sum` method.
