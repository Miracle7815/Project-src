Sure, let's break down the possible equivalence classes for the `sum_product` method based on the input `numbers`.

The method calculates the sum and product of all integers in the provided list. We need to consider different scenarios that could affect the behavior of the method:

- class:
    1. `numbers`: is null
- class:
    1. `numbers`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains only one element
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple elements, all positive
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple elements, including negative numbers
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple elements, including zero
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple elements, both positive and negative, including zero

These partitions ensure that we cover various edge cases and typical use cases for the method.
