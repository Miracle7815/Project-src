Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `l` should be generated to test the API method, which represents whether or not the array is monotonic.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `l`:

- class:
    1. `l`: is null
- class:
    1. `l`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `l`: is an array with one element
- class:
    1. `l`: is a strictly increasing array
- class:
    1. `l`: is a strictly decreasing array
- class:
    1. `l`: is a non-decreasing array (with duplicates)
- class:
    1. `l`: is a non-increasing array (with duplicates)
- class:
    1. `l`: is neither increasing nor decreasing (random order)

These partitions ensure that we cover all possible scenarios for the `monotonic` method.
