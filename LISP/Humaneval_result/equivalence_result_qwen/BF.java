Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `planet1` and `planet2` should be generated to test the API method, which represents finding the planets between two given planets in the solar system.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `planet1` and `planet2`:

- class:
  1. `planet1`: is null; 2. `planet2`: can be any string
- class:
  1. `planet2`: is null; 2. `planet1`: can be any string
- class:
  1. `planet1`: is not a valid planet name; 2. `planet2`: can be any string
- class:
  1. `planet2`: is not a valid planet name; 2. `planet1`: can be any string
- class:
  1. `planet1`: is a valid planet name; 2. `planet2`: is the same valid planet name as `planet1`
- class:
  1. `planet1`: is a valid planet name; 2. `planet2`: is a valid planet name after `planet1` in the list
- class:
  1. `planet1`: is a valid planet name; 2. `planet2`: is a valid planet name before `planet1` in the list
