Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `text` should be generated to test the API method, which represents replacing spaces in a string according to certain rules.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `text`:

- class:
    1. `text`: is null
- class:
    1. `text`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `text`: contains no spaces
- class:
    1. `text`: contains one space between words
- class:
    1. `text`: contains two spaces between words
- class:
    1. `text`: contains more than two spaces between words
- class:
    1. `text`: starts with one space
- class:
    1. `text`: starts with two spaces
- class:
    1. `text`: starts with more than two spaces
- class:
    1. `text`: ends with one space
- class:
    1. `text`: ends with two spaces
- class:
    1. `text`: ends with more than two spaces
- class:
    1. `text`: contains leading, trailing, and multiple spaces between words
- class:
    1. `text`: contains only spaces

These classes ensure that all possible scenarios related to the presence and positioning of spaces within the input string are covered.
