Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `a` and `b` should be generated to test the API method, which represents an XOR operation between two strings of equal length.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `a` and `b`:

- class:
  1. `a`: is null; 2. `b`: can be any String
- class:
  1. `b`: is null; 2. `a`: can be any String
- class:
  1. `a`: is an empty string; 2. `b`: is an empty string
- class:
  1. `a`: is a string with length N; 2. `b`: is a string with length less than N
- class:
  1. `a`: is a string with length N; 2. `b`: is a string with length greater than N
- class:
  1. `a`: is a string with all characters '0'; 2. `b`: is a string with all characters '0'
- class:
  1. `a`: is a string with all characters '1'; 2. `b`: is a string with all characters '1'
- class:
  1. `a`: is a string with all characters '0'; 2. `b`: is a string with all characters '1'
- class:
  1. `a`: is a string with all characters '1'; 2. `b`: is a string with all characters '0'
- class:
  1. `a`: is a string with mixed characters '0' and '1'; 2. `b`: is a string with mixed characters '0' and '1', where some characters match and some do not

Note: The method assumes that the input strings `a` and `b` are of equal length. However, since this is not explicitly checked in the method, we should also consider cases where the lengths of `a` and `b` differ. These cases will likely result in a `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
