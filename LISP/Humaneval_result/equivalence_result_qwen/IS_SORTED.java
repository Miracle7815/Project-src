Certainly! The `is_sorted` method checks if an array of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order and ensures that no integer appears more than twice. We need to generate test cases that cover all possible scenarios for the input array `lst`.

Here are the equivalence classes for the input array `lst`:

- class:
  1. `lst`: is null
- class:
  1. `lst`: is an empty array
- class:
  1. `lst`: contains only one element
- class:
  1. `lst`: contains two elements, and they are in non-decreasing order
- class:
  1. `lst`: contains two elements, and they are in decreasing order
- class:
  1. `lst`: contains more than two elements, all elements are in non-decreasing order, and no element appears more than twice
- class:
  1. `lst`: contains more than two elements, all elements are in non-decreasing order, but at least one element appears more than twice
- class:
  1. `lst`: contains more than two elements, and they are not in non-decreasing order, but no element appears more than twice
- class:
  1. `lst`: contains duplicate elements, some of which appear exactly twice, and the array is in non-decreasing order
- class:
  1. `lst`: contains duplicate elements, some of which appear exactly twice, and the array is not in non-decreasing order

These classes cover various scenarios including edge cases and typical use cases for the `is_sorted` method.
