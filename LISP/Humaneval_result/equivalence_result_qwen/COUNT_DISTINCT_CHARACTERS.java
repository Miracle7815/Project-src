Certainly! Let's partition the equivalence classes for the input `string` in the `count_distinct_characters` method.

The method counts the number of distinct characters in a string, ignoring case. We need to cover different scenarios including edge cases.

- class:
    1. `string`: is null
- class:
    1. `string`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `string`: contains only one unique character, all uppercase
- class:
    1. `string`: contains only one unique character, all lowercase
- class:
    1. `string`: contains multiple unique characters, mixed case
- class:
    1. `string`: contains repeated characters, mixed case
- class:
    1. `string`: contains only whitespace characters
- class:
    1. `string`: contains special characters (e.g., punctuation, symbols)
- class:
    1. `string`: contains a mix of letters, numbers, special characters, and whitespace
- class:
    1. `string`: contains a very long sequence of characters

These classes should help ensure that the method is thoroughly tested under various conditions.
