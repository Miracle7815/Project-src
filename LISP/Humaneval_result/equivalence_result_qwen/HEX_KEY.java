Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `num` should be generated to test the API method, which counts the number of specific characters ('2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D') in a given string.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `num`:

- class:
    1. `num`: is null
- class:
    1. `num`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `num`: contains only characters that are not in the set {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}
- class:
    1. `num`: contains only characters that are in the set {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}
- class:
    1. `num`: contains a mix of characters, some of which are in the set {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'} and some of which are not
- class:
    1. `num`: contains only one character that is in the set {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}
- class:
    1. `num`: contains only one character that is not in the set {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}
- class:
    1. `num`: contains repeated characters, some of which are in the set {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}
- class:
    1. `num`: contains a large number of characters, including some that are in the set {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}

These classes cover various scenarios and edge cases for the input string `num`.
