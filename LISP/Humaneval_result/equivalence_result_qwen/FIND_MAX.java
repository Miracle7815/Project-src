Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `words` should be generated to test the API method, which represents finding the maximum string based on the number of unique characters and lexicographical order.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `words`:

- class:
    1. `words`: is null
- class:
    1. `words`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `words`: contains only one word
- class:
    1. `words`: contains multiple words with different numbers of unique characters
- class:
    1. `words`: contains multiple words with the same number of unique characters but different lexicographical orders
- class:
    1. `words`: contains multiple words with the same number of unique characters and the same lexicographical order
- class:
    1. `words`: contains words with special characters, digits, and letters
- class:
    1. `words`: contains words with varying cases (upper and lower)

These classes cover a wide range of scenarios that could be encountered when using the `find_max` method.
