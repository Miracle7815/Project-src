Certainly! Let's partition the equivalence classes for the input parameters of the methods `is_prime` and `largest_prime_factor`.

### For `is_prime(int k)`:

1. **class:**
   - `k`: is less than 2
2. **class:**
   - `k`: is 2 (smallest prime number)
3. **class:**
   - `k`: is an even number greater than 2
4. **class:**
   - `k`: is an odd prime number greater than 2
5. **class:**
   - `k`: is an odd composite number greater than 2

### For `largest_prime_factor(int n)`:

1. **class:**
   - `n`: is less than 2 (no prime factors)
2. **class:**
   - `n`: is a prime number
3. **class:**
   - `n`: is a composite number with small prime factors
4. **class:**
   - `n`: is a composite number with large prime factors
5. **class:**
   - `n`: is a composite number with repeated prime factors
6. **class:**
   - `n`: is a composite number with both small and large prime factors

Here is a more detailed breakdown:

#### `is_prime(int k)`:
- **class:** `k < 2` (e.g., -1, 0, 1) - These values are not prime.
- **class:** `k = 2` - The smallest prime number.
- **class:** `k > 2` and `k` is even (e.g., 4, 6, 8) - Even numbers greater than 2 are not prime.
- **class:** `k > 2` and `k` is an odd prime number (e.g., 3, 5, 7, 11) - These values are prime.
- **class:** `k > 2` and `k` is an odd composite number (e.g., 9, 15, 21) - These values are not prime.

#### `largest_prime_factor(int n)`:
- **class:** `n < 2` (e.g., -1, 0, 1) - No prime factors.
- **class:** `n` is a prime number (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) - The largest prime factor is the number itself.
- **class:** `n` is a composite number with small prime factors (e.g., 10, 14, 15) - The largest prime factor is one of the small primes.
- **class:** `n` is a composite number with large prime factors (e.g., 143 = 11 * 13) - The largest prime factor is one of the large primes.
- **class:** `n` is a composite number with repeated prime factors (e.g., 18 = 2 * 3 * 3) - The largest prime factor is the largest repeated prime.
- **class:** `n` is a composite number with both small and large prime factors (e.g., 231 = 3 * 7 * 11) - The largest prime factor is the largest among both small and large primes.
