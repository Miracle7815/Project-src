Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `string` should be generated to test the API method, which represents the length of the input string.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `string`:

- class:
    1. `string`: is null
- class:
    1. `string`: is an empty string ("")
- class:
    1. `string`: contains only one character
- class:
    1. `string`: contains multiple characters (e.g., "abc", "hello world")
- class:
    1. `string`: contains whitespace characters (e.g., " ", "\t", "\n")
- class:
    1. `string`: contains special characters (e.g., "!@#$%", "^&*()", "{}[]")
- class:
    1. `string`: contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
- class:
    1. `string`: contains very long sequence of characters (to test performance and limits)

These partitions aim to cover a wide variety of possible inputs to ensure the function behaves as expected across different scenarios.
