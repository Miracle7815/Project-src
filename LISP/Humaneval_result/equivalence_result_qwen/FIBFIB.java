Sure, let's break down the input parameter `n` for the `fibfib` method to create meaningful equivalence classes.

The `fibfib` function is a recursive function that calculates a value based on the input `n`. We need to consider various ranges of `n` to ensure all branches and conditions in the function are tested.

Here are the equivalence classes:

- class:
  1. `n`: is less than 0 (negative numbers)
- class:
  1. `n`: equals 0
- class:
  1. `n`: equals 1
- class:
  1. `n`: equals 2
- class:
  1. `n`: greater than 2 (positive integers)

These classes cover all possible values of `n` that the function might encounter and ensure that all conditions and branches within the function are tested.
