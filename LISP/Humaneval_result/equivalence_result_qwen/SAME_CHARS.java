Sure, let's partition the equivalence classes for the parameters `s0` and `s1` of the `same_chars` method.

The method checks if two strings contain the exact same set of unique characters, regardless of their order or frequency.

Here are the equivalence classes:

- class:
  1. `s0`: is null; 2. `s1`: can be any String
- class:
  1. `s1`: is null; 2. `s0`: can be any String
- class:
  1. `s0`: is an empty string; 2. `s1`: is an empty string
- class:
  1. `s0`: is an empty string; 2. `s1`: contains one or more characters
- class:
  1. `s0`: contains one or more characters; 2. `s1`: is an empty string
- class:
  1. `s0`: contains one or more characters; 2. `s1`: contains the same set of unique characters as `s0`, but possibly in a different order
- class:
  1. `s0`: contains one or more characters; 2. `s1`: contains a subset of the unique characters of `s0`
- class:
  1. `s0`: contains one or more characters; 2. `s1`: contains a superset of the unique characters of `s0`
- class:
  1. `s0`: contains one or more characters; 2. `s1`: contains some of the same unique characters as `s0` and some different ones
- class:
  1. `s0`: contains one or more characters; 2. `s1`: contains entirely different unique characters from `s0`

These partitions cover various scenarios including null inputs, empty strings, and different combinations of character sets in the input strings.
