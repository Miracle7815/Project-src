Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `nums` should be generated to test the API method, which represents counting numbers in an array that start and end with an odd digit and are greater than 10.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `nums`:

- class:
    1. `nums`: is null
- class:
    1. `nums`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains only numbers less than or equal to 10
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains numbers greater than 10, but none start and end with an odd digit
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains numbers greater than 10, some of which start and end with an odd digit
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains numbers greater than 10, all of which start and end with an odd digit

This will ensure that we cover all possible scenarios and edge cases for the `special_filter` method.
