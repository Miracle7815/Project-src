Based on the provided method `even_odd_palindrome` and its dependency `is_palindrome`, we need to generate various test cases to cover all possible scenarios.

Here are the equivalence classes for the input parameter `n`:

- class:
    1. `n`: is less than 1 (negative numbers, zero)
- class:
    1. `n`: is equal to 1
- class:
    1. `n`: is a small positive integer (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- class:
    1. `n`: is a larger positive integer that includes both even and odd palindromes (e.g., 10, 11, 12, ..., 100, 101, ...)
- class:
    1. `n`: is a very large positive integer (e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE)

These classes cover a wide range of input values, ensuring that the method behaves correctly across different scenarios. Each class will help identify potential edge cases and ensure the robustness of the implementation.
