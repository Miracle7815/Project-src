Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `numbers` should be generated to test the API method, which represents filtering out positive integers from a list.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `numbers`:

- class:
  1. `numbers`: is null
- class:
  1. `numbers`: is an empty list
- class:
  1. `numbers`: contains only positive integers
- class:
  1. `numbers`: contains only non-positive integers (zero and negative integers)
- class:
  1. `numbers`: contains a mix of positive integers, zero, and negative integers

Each of these classes covers different scenarios and ensures that the method behaves as expected under various conditions.
