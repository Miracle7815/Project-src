Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `arr` should be generated to test the API method, which represents whether the array can be rotated to become sorted.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.

Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `arr`:

- class:
    1. `arr`: is null

- class:
    1. `arr`: is an empty list

- class:
    1. `arr`: contains only one element

- class:
    1. `arr`: is already sorted in ascending order

- class:
    1. `arr`: is sorted in descending order

- class:
    1. `arr`: can be rotated to become sorted in ascending order (e.g., [3, 4, 5, 1, 2])

- class:
    1. `arr`: cannot be rotated to become sorted in ascending order (e.g., [3, 1, 4, 2, 5])

These classes cover various scenarios and edge cases that the method may encounter.
