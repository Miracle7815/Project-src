Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `string` should be generated to test the API method, which determines whether the length of the input string is a prime number.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `string`:

- class:
    1. `string`: is null
- class:
    1. `string`: is an empty string (`length() == 0`)
- class:
    1. `string`: has length 1 (`length() == 1`)
- class:
    1. `string`: has a prime length greater than 1 (e.g., `length() == 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...`)
- class:
    1. `string`: has a non-prime length greater than 1 (e.g., `length() == 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, ...`)
