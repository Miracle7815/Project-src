Certainly! We need to consider different types of input strings to ensure that all parts of the code are tested effectively. Here are the equivalence classes for the `encode` method:

- class:
    1. `message`: is null
- class:
    1. `message`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `message`: contains only uppercase letters
- class:
    1. `message`: contains only lowercase letters
- class:
    1. `message`: contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
- class:
    1. `message`: contains only vowels (both uppercase and lowercase)
- class:
    1. `message`: contains only consonants (both uppercase and lowercase)
- class:
    1. `message`: contains a mix of vowels and consonants (both uppercase and lowercase)
- class:
    1. `message`: contains special characters, digits, and spaces
- class:
    1. `message`: contains a mix of all the above categories

Each of these classes will help us verify that the method correctly handles different types of input strings.
