Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `lst` and `x` should be generated to test the API method `get_row`, which returns a list of tuples representing the coordinates where the value `x` is found in the 2D list `lst`.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `lst` and `x`:

- class:
    1. `lst`: is null; 2. `x`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty list; 2. `x`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `lst`: is a 2D list with at least one row and one column, but does not contain the value `x`; 2. `x`: is an integer not present in `lst`
- class:
    1. `lst`: is a 2D list with at least one row and one column, and contains the value `x` only once; 2. `x`: is an integer present in `lst` exactly once
- class:
    1. `lst`: is a 2D list with at least one row and one column, and contains the value `x` multiple times; 2. `x`: is an integer present in `lst` more than once
- class:
    1. `lst`: is a 2D list with multiple rows and columns, and contains the value `x` in multiple rows and columns; 2. `x`: is an integer present in `lst` in multiple positions

These partitions cover different scenarios and edge cases for the `get_row` method.
