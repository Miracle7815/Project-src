Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `lst` should be generated to test the API method, which represents an operation to sum the squares of all positive odd integers in a given array of doubles.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `lst`:

- class:
    1. `lst`: is null
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only non-integer values
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only even integer values
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only negative odd integer values
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only positive odd integer values
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains a mix of positive odd, negative odd, even integers, and non-integer values
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains duplicate positive odd integers
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains duplicate negative odd integers
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains duplicate even integers
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains duplicate non-integer values
