Certainly! We need to consider various cases for the parameters `x`, `y`, and `z` to ensure that all possible paths through the method are tested. Here are the equivalence classes:

- class:
  1. `x`: is not an integer (e.g., 1.5); 2. `y`: can be any double; 3. `z`: can be any double
- class:
  1. `y`: is not an integer (e.g., 2.5); 2. `x`: can be any double; 3. `z`: can be any double
- class:
  1. `z`: is not an integer (e.g., 3.5); 2. `x`: can be any double; 3. `y`: can be any double
- class:
  1. `x`: is an integer (e.g., 1); 2. `y`: is not an integer (e.g., 2.5); 3. `z`: can be any double
- class:
  1. `x`: is an integer (e.g., 1); 2. `y`: is an integer (e.g., 2); 3. `z`: is not an integer (e.g., 3.5)
- class:
  1. `x`: is an integer (e.g., 1); 2. `y`: is an integer (e.g., 2); 3. `z`: is an integer (e.g., 3); 4. `x + y == z`
- class:
  1. `x`: is an integer (e.g., 1); 2. `y`: is an integer (e.g., 2); 3. `z`: is an integer (e.g., 3); 4. `x + z == y`
- class:
  1. `x`: is an integer (e.g., 1); 2. `y`: is an integer (e.g., 2); 3. `z`: is an integer (e.g., 3); 4. `y + z == x`
- class:
  1. `x`: is an integer (e.g., 1); 2. `y`: is an integer (e.g., 2); 3. `z`: is an integer (e.g., 6); 4. None of the conditions (`x + y == z`, `x + z == y`, `y + z == x`) are satisfied

These equivalence classes cover all the necessary scenarios for the method `any_int`.
