Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `l` should be generated to test the API method, which sorts every third element of the list while keeping other elements in their original positions.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `l`:

- class:
    1. `l`: is null
- class:
    1. `l`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `l`: has only one element
- class:
    1. `l`: has two elements
- class:
    1. `l`: has three elements
- class:
    1. `l`: has a number of elements that is a multiple of three
- class:
    1. `l`: has a number of elements that is not a multiple of three
- class:
    1. `l`: all elements are the same
- class:
    1. `l`: elements are in ascending order
- class:
    1. `l`: elements are in descending order
- class:
    1. `l`: elements are in random order

Each of these classes covers different scenarios and edge cases for the `sort_third` method.
