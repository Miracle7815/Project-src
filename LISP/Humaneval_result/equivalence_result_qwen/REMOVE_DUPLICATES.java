Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `numbers` should be generated to test the API method, which removes duplicates from a list of integers, keeping only the elements that appear exactly once.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `numbers`:

- class:
  1. `numbers`: is null

- class:
  1. `numbers`: is an empty list

- class:
  1. `numbers`: contains all unique elements

- class:
  1. `numbers`: contains all duplicate elements

- class:
  1. `numbers`: contains a mix of unique and duplicate elements

- class:
  1. `numbers`: contains negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers with duplicates and unique elements

- class:
  1. `numbers`: contains large numbers (close to Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE) with duplicates and unique elements

Here are some example instances for each class:

- class: `numbers`: null
- class: `numbers`: []
- class: `numbers`: [1, 2, 3, 4]
- class: `numbers`: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]
- class: `numbers`: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
- class: `numbers`: [-1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 2]
- class: `numbers`: [Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE, 0, 1]
