Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `n` should be generated to test the API method, which represents whether or not a given integer `n` is a prime number. 

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `n`:

- class:
    1. `n`: less than 2
- class:
    1. `n`: equal to 2
- class:
    1. `n`: greater than 2, even number
- class:
    1. `n`: greater than 2, odd prime number
- class:
    1. `n`: greater than 2, odd non-prime number (composite)

These partitions cover the basic scenarios and edge cases for the `is_prime` function.
