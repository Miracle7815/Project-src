Certainly! Let's break down the method and identify the equivalence classes for the input list `lst`.

### Method Analysis:
The `strange_sort_list` method sorts a list of integers in a "strange" order where it alternates between picking the minimum and maximum values from the remaining elements until the list is empty.

### Equivalence Classes:

1. **Empty List**:
   - class: `lst` is an empty list.
   
2. **Single Element List**:
   - class: `lst` contains exactly one element.

3. **All Elements Same**:
   - class: `lst` contains all identical elements.

4. **Two Distinct Elements**:
   - class: `lst` contains exactly two distinct elements.

5. **Multiple Distinct Elements**:
   - class: `lst` contains multiple distinct elements.

6. **List with Negative Numbers**:
   - class: `lst` contains negative numbers.

7. **List with Positive and Negative Numbers**:
   - class: `lst` contains both positive and negative numbers.

8. **Large List**:
   - class: `lst` contains a large number of elements (e.g., more than 100).

9. **Sorted List**:
   - class: `lst` is already sorted in ascending order.

10. **Reverse Sorted List**:
    - class: `lst` is already sorted in descending order.

11. **Random Order List**:
    - class: `lst` is in random order.

### Example Equivalence Class Details:

- **class**: `lst` is an empty list.
  - Input: `[]`
  
- **class**: `lst` contains exactly one element.
  - Input: `[5]`
  
- **class**: `lst` contains all identical elements.
  - Input: `[3, 3, 3, 3]`
  
- **class**: `lst` contains exactly two distinct elements.
  - Input: `[1, 2]`
  
- **class**: `lst` contains multiple distinct elements.
  - Input: `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]`
  
- **class**: `lst` contains negative numbers.
  - Input: `[-3, -1, -4, -1, -5, -9, -2, -6]`
  
- **class**: `lst` contains both positive and negative numbers.
  - Input: `[3, -1, 4, -1, 5, -9, 2, -6]`
  
- **class**: `lst` contains a large number of elements.
  - Input: A list with 100 or more random integers.
  
- **class**: `lst` is already sorted in ascending order.
  - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  
- **class**: `lst` is already sorted in descending order.
  - Input: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
  
- **class**: `lst` is in random order.
  - Input: `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]` (random order)

These equivalence classes cover various scenarios that the method might encounter, ensuring comprehensive testing.
