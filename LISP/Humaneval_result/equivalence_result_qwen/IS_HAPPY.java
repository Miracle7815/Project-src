Certainly! Let's partition the equivalence classes for the input string `s` based on the behavior of the `is_happy` method.

The method checks if the length of the string is less than 3, returning `false` if it is. Then, it iterates through the string to ensure that no three consecutive characters contain any duplicates. If such a triplet is found, it returns `false`; otherwise, it returns `true`.

Here are the equivalence classes:

- class:
    1. `s`: is null
- class:
    1. `s`: is an empty string (`""`)
- class:
    1. `s`: has a length of 1 (e.g., `"a"`)
- class:
    1. `s`: has a length of 2 (e.g., `"ab"`)
- class:
    1. `s`: has a length of 3 with all unique characters (e.g., `"abc"`)
- class:
    1. `s`: has a length of 3 with at least two identical characters (e.g., `"aab"`, `"aba"`, `"abb"`)
- class:
    1. `s`: has a length greater than 3 with all unique triplets (e.g., `"abcd"`, `"abcdef"`)
- class:
    1. `s`: has a length greater than 3 with at least one triplet containing duplicate characters (e.g., `"aabbcc"`, `"abac"`, `"aabb"`)

These classes cover all possible scenarios for the input string `s` and ensure that the method is tested thoroughly.
