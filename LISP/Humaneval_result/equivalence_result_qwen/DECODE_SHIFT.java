Certainly! Let's analyze the `encode_shift` and `decode_shift` methods from the `DECODE_SHIFT` class. The methods perform a simple Caesar cipher shift on the input string, where `encode_shift` shifts characters by 5 positions forward in the alphabet, and `decode_shift` shifts characters by 21 positions forward (which is equivalent to shifting 5 positions backward).

### Equivalence Classes for `encode_shift`:

1. **class:**
   - `string`: is null
   - This will cause a `NullPointerException`.

2. **class:**
   - `string`: is an empty string
   - Should return an empty string.

3. **class:**
   - `string`: contains only lowercase alphabetic characters
   - Each character should be shifted by 5 positions forward in the alphabet.

4. **class:**
   - `string`: contains only uppercase alphabetic characters
   - The method will treat these as non-alphabetic characters and will not shift them (since it only checks for lowercase 'a' to 'z').

5. **class:**
   - `string`: contains only non-alphabetic characters (e.g., digits, punctuation, spaces)
   - These characters should remain unchanged.

6. **class:**
   - `string`: contains a mix of lowercase alphabetic characters and non-alphabetic characters
   - Lowercase alphabetic characters should be shifted, while others remain unchanged.

7. **class:**
   - `string`: contains only characters near the end of the alphabet ('v' to 'z')
   - These characters should wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet after shifting.

### Equivalence Classes for `decode_shift`:

1. **class:**
   - `string`: is null
   - This will cause a `NullPointerException`.

2. **class:**
   - `string`: is an empty string
   - Should return an empty string.

3. **class:**
   - `string`: contains only lowercase alphabetic characters
   - Each character should be shifted by 21 positions forward in the alphabet (equivalent to shifting 5 positions backward).

4. **class:**
   - `string`: contains only uppercase alphabetic characters
   - The method will treat these as non-alphabetic characters and will not shift them.

5. **class:**
   - `string`: contains only non-alphabetic characters (e.g., digits, punctuation, spaces)
   - These characters should remain unchanged.

6. **class:**
   - `string`: contains a mix of lowercase alphabetic characters and non-alphabetic characters
   - Lowercase alphabetic characters should be shifted, while others remain unchanged.

7. **class:**
   - `string`: contains only characters near the beginning of the alphabet ('a' to 'e')
   - These characters should wrap around to the end of the alphabet after shifting.

These equivalence classes cover a variety of scenarios to ensure that both `encode_shift` and `decode_shift` methods are thoroughly tested.
