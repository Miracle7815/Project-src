Sure, let's partition the equivalence classes for the parameters `grid` and `bucket_capacity` for the `max_fill` method.

### Equivalence Classes:

#### For `grid`:
1. **class:**
   - `grid`: is null
2. **class:**
   - `grid`: is an empty array (0x0 matrix)
3. **class:**
   - `grid`: is a non-empty array with all elements as zero
4. **class:**
   - `grid`: is a non-empty array with positive integers
5. **class:**
   - `grid`: is a non-empty array with negative integers (if applicable, otherwise ignore since it doesn't make sense for a grid of capacities)
6. **class:**
   - `grid`: is a non-empty array with mixed positive and zero values
7. **class:**
   - `grid`: is a non-empty array with mixed positive and negative values (if applicable, otherwise ignore)

#### For `bucket_capacity`:
1. **class:**
   - `bucket_capacity`: is less than or equal to zero (invalid input)
2. **class:**
   - `bucket_capacity`: is 1 (minimum valid input)
3. **class:**
   - `bucket_capacity`: is greater than 1 but less than the maximum possible sum of a row in `grid`
4. **class:**
   - `bucket_capacity`: is equal to the maximum possible sum of a row in `grid`
5. **class:**
   - `bucket_capacity`: is greater than the maximum possible sum of a row in `grid`

### Combined Equivalence Classes:

Now, we combine these classes to cover various scenarios:

1. **class:**
   - `grid`: is null
   - `bucket_capacity`: can be any integer

2. **class:**
   - `grid`: is an empty array (0x0 matrix)
   - `bucket_capacity`: can be any integer

3. **class:**
   - `grid`: is a non-empty array with all elements as zero
   - `bucket_capacity`: is less than or equal to zero

4. **class:**
   - `grid`: is a non-empty array with all elements as zero
   - `bucket_capacity`: is 1

5. **class:**
   - `grid`: is a non-empty array with all elements as zero
   - `bucket_capacity`: is greater than 1

6. **class:**
   - `grid`: is a non-empty array with positive integers
   - `bucket_capacity`: is less than or equal to zero

7. **class:**
   - `grid`: is a non-empty array with positive integers
   - `bucket_capacity`: is 1

8. **class:**
   - `grid`: is a non-empty array with positive integers
   - `bucket_capacity`: is greater than 1 but less than the maximum possible sum of a row in `grid`

9. **class:**
   - `grid`: is a non-empty array with positive integers
   - `bucket_capacity`: is equal to the maximum possible sum of a row in `grid`

10. **class:**
    - `grid`: is a non-empty array with positive integers
    - `bucket_capacity`: is greater than the maximum possible sum of a row in `grid`

These classes ensure that we cover a wide range of input scenarios for the `max_fill` method.
