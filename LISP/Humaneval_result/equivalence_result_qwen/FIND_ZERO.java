Based on the method signatures and bodies, the instances of `xs` and `x` for the `poly` method, and `xs` for the `find_zero` method should be generated to test these API methods.

For `poly` method:
- class:
    1. `xs`: is null; 2. `x`: can be any double
- class:
    1. `xs`: is empty; 2. `x`: can be any double
- class:
    1. `xs`: contains only one element; 2. `x`: can be any double
- class:
    1. `xs`: contains multiple elements; 2. `x`: can be any double

For `find_zero` method:
- class:
    1. `xs`: is null
- class:
    1. `xs`: is empty
- class:
    1. `xs`: contains only one element, and the polynomial has a zero within the initial range [-1, 1]
- class:
    1. `xs`: contains only one element, and the polynomial does not have a zero within the initial range [-1, 1]
- class:
    1. `xs`: contains multiple elements, and the polynomial has a zero within the initial range [-1, 1]
- class:
    1. `xs`: contains multiple elements, and the polynomial does not have a zero within the initial range [-1, 1], but it has a zero outside this range
- class:
    1. `xs`: contains multiple elements, and the polynomial does not have any zeros

These partitions aim to cover various scenarios including edge cases and typical use cases.
