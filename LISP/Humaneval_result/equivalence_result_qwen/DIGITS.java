Sure, let's partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `n` in the `digits` method:

- class:
    1. `n`: is 0 (no odd digits)
- class:
    1. `n`: is a positive number with no odd digits (e.g., 2468)
- class:
    1. `n`: is a positive number with one odd digit (e.g., 24681)
- class:
    1. `n`: is a positive number with multiple odd digits (e.g., 13579)
- class:
    1. `n`: is a negative number with no odd digits (e.g., -2468)
- class:
    1. `n`: is a negative number with one odd digit (e.g., -24681)
- class:
    1. `n`: is a negative number with multiple odd digits (e.g., -13579)

Each of these classes will help ensure that the method is tested under various conditions, including edge cases like zero and negative numbers.
