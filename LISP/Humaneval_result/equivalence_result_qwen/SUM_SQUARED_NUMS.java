Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `lst` should be generated to test the API method, which represents the sum of the squares of the ceiling values of the numbers in the array.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `lst`:

- class:
  1. `lst`: is null

- class:
  1. `lst`: is an empty array

- class:
  1. `lst`: contains only positive integers

- class:
  1. `lst`: contains only negative integers

- class:
  1. `lst`: contains both positive and negative integers

- class:
  1. `lst`: contains only positive decimal numbers (non-integers)

- class:
  1. `lst`: contains only negative decimal numbers (non-integers)

- class:
  1. `lst`: contains both positive and negative decimal numbers (non-integers)

- class:
  1. `lst`: contains a mix of integers and decimal numbers

- class:
  1. `lst`: contains very large numbers that could cause overflow when squared

- class:
  1. `lst`: contains very small numbers close to zero

- class:
  1. `lst`: contains a single element

- class:
  1. `lst`: contains duplicate elements

Each of these classes will help ensure that the method handles different types of input arrays correctly.
