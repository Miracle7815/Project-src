Certainly! We need to identify the equivalence classes for the input parameters `lst1` and `lst2`. The method calculates the total length of strings in each list and returns the list with the smaller or equal total length.

Here are the equivalence classes:

- class:
    1. `lst1`: is null; 2. `lst2`: can be any list
- class:
    1. `lst2`: is null; 2. `lst1`: can be any list
- class:
    1. `lst1`: is an empty list; 2. `lst2`: can be any list
- class:
    1. `lst2`: is an empty list; 2. `lst1`: can be any list
- class:
    1. `lst1`: contains one or more non-null strings; 2. `lst2`: contains one or more non-null strings; 3. Total length of strings in `lst1` is less than total length of strings in `lst2`
- class:
    1. `lst1`: contains one or more non-null strings; 2. `lst2`: contains one or more non-null strings; 3. Total length of strings in `lst1` is greater than total length of strings in `lst2`
- class:
    1. `lst1`: contains one or more non-null strings; 2. `lst2`: contains one or more non-null strings; 3. Total length of strings in `lst1` is equal to total length of strings in `lst2`

These classes cover the scenarios where either list could be null or empty, and the scenarios where the total lengths of the strings in the lists are compared.
