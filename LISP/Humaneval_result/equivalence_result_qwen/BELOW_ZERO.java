Sure, let's partition the equivalence classes for the `operations` parameter in the `below_zero` method.

### Equivalence Classes:

1. **Empty List**:
   - `operations`: is an empty list.
   
2. **All Positive Numbers**:
   - `operations`: contains only positive integers.
   
3. **All Negative Numbers**:
   - `operations`: contains only negative integers.
   
4. **Mixed Positive and Negative Numbers**:
   - `operations`: contains both positive and negative integers.
   
5. **Sum Equals Zero**:
   - `operations`: contains a mix of positive and negative integers such that their sum equals zero.
   
6. **Sum Less Than Zero**:
   - `operations`: contains a mix of positive and negative integers such that their sum is less than zero.
   
7. **Sum Greater Than Zero**:
   - `operations`: contains a mix of positive and negative integers such that their sum is greater than zero.
   
8. **Single Positive Number**:
   - `operations`: contains a single positive integer.
   
9. **Single Negative Number**:
   - `operations`: contains a single negative integer.
   
10. **Single Zero**:
    - `operations`: contains a single zero.
    
11. **List with Multiple Zeros**:
    - `operations`: contains multiple zeros.
    
12. **Large Numbers**:
    - `operations`: contains large positive and/or negative integers that might cause overflow issues.
    
13. **Small Numbers**:
    - `operations`: contains small positive and/or negative integers.
    
14. **Boundary Values**:
    - `operations`: contains boundary values such as Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE.
