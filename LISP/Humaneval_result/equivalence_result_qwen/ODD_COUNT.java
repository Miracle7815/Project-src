Sure, let's break down the method and determine the equivalence classes for the input `lst`.

The `odd_count` method takes an `ArrayList<String>` as input, iterates over each string in the list, counts the number of odd digits in each string, and then constructs a result string with the count repeated multiple times in a specific format.

We need to consider different scenarios for the input list `lst`:

- class:
    1. `lst`: is null
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains strings with only even digits
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains strings with only odd digits
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains strings with both even and odd digits
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains strings with non-digit characters
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains strings with mixed content (digits, letters, special characters)

These partitions help ensure that we cover various edge cases and typical scenarios for the input list `lst`. Here's how you might write these out:

- class:
    1. `lst`: is null
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty list (`new ArrayList<String>()`)
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains strings with only even digits (e.g., `["24680", "86420"]`)
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains strings with only odd digits (e.g., `["13579", "97531"]`)
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains strings with both even and odd digits (e.g., `["12345", "67890"]`)
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains strings with non-digit characters (e.g., `["abc", "!@#"]`)
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains strings with mixed content (e.g., `["a1b2c3", "1!2@3#"]`)
