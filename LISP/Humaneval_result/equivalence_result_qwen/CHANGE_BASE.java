Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `x` and `base` should be generated to test the API method, which converts a decimal number to a string representation in a given base.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches and edge cases in the method body. Here are the equivalence classes for `x` and `base`:

- class:
    1. `x`: is 0; 2. `base`: can be any valid integer greater than 1 (e.g., 2, 8, 10, 16)

- class:
    1. `x`: is a positive integer; 2. `base`: is less than 2 (invalid base)

- class:
    1. `x`: is a positive integer; 2. `base`: is 2 (binary conversion)

- class:
    1. `x`: is a positive integer; 2. `base`: is 8 (octal conversion)

- class:
    1. `x`: is a positive integer; 2. `base`: is 10 (decimal conversion)

- class:
    1. `x`: is a positive integer; 2. `base`: is 16 (hexadecimal conversion)

- class:
    1. `x`: is a positive integer; 2. `base`: is greater than 16 (valid but uncommon base)

- class:
    1. `x`: is a negative integer; 2. `base`: can be any valid integer greater than 1 (method does not handle negative numbers correctly)

- class:
    1. `x`: is a large positive integer; 2. `base`: can be any valid integer greater than 1 (to test performance and correctness with large numbers)

These equivalence classes should help cover the various scenarios and edge cases for the `change_base` method.
