Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `a`, `b`, and `c` should be generated to test the API method, which calculates the area of a triangle given the lengths of its sides.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `a`, `b`, and `c`:

- class:
    1. `a`: is less than or equal to 0; 2. `b`: can be any double; 3. `c`: can be any double
- class:
    1. `b`: is less than or equal to 0; 2. `a`: can be any double; 3. `c`: can be any double
- class:
    1. `c`: is less than or equal to 0; 2. `a`: can be any double; 3. `b`: can be any double
- class:
    1. `a`: and `b` and `c` can form a non-triangle (e.g., `a + b <= c`); 2. `a`: can be any positive double; 3. `b`: can be any positive double; 4. `c`: can be any positive double
- class:
    1. `a`: and `b` and `c` can form a valid triangle; 2. `a`: can be any positive double; 3. `b`: can be any positive double; 4. `c`: can be any positive double

These classes cover the cases where the input values are invalid (non-positive or cannot form a triangle) and valid (can form a triangle).
