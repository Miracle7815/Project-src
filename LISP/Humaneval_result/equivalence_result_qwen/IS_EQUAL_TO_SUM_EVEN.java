Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `n` should be generated to test the API method, which checks whether a number is even and greater than or equal to 8.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `n`:

- class:
    1. `n`: is less than 8 and even
- class:
    1. `n`: is less than 8 and odd
- class:
    1. `n`: is 8
- class:
    1. `n`: is greater than 8 and even
- class:
    1. `n`: is greater than 8 and odd

This partitioning ensures that all possible conditions are tested, including edge cases like the boundary value of 8.
