Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `a`, `b`, and `c` should be generated to test the API method, which represents whether or not the three sides can form a right-angled triangle.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.

Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `a`, `b`, and `c`:

- class:
    1. `a`, `b`, `c`: any set of integers where `a <= 0` or `b <= 0` or `c <= 0` (invalid triangle sides)
- class:
    1. `a`, `b`, `c`: any set of integers where `a == b == c` (equilateral triangle, cannot be a right-angled triangle)
- class:
    1. `a`, `b`, `c`: any set of integers where two sides are equal and the third side is such that they do not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem (isosceles but not right-angled triangle)
- class:
    1. `a`, `b`, `c`: any set of integers where all sides are different and they do not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem (scalene but not right-angled triangle)
- class:
    1. `a`, `b`, `c`: any set of integers where `a*a + b*b == c*c` (right-angled triangle, with `c` as the hypotenuse)
- class:
    1. `a`, `b`, `c`: any set of integers where `b*b + c*c == a*a` (right-angled triangle, with `a` as the hypotenuse)
- class:
    1. `a`, `b`, `c`: any set of integers where `c*c + a*a == b*b` (right-angled triangle, with `b` as the hypotenuse)

These partitions ensure that the method is tested for invalid inputs, different types of triangles, and valid right-angled triangles with different configurations.
