Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `lst` should be generated to test the API method, which represents the sum of odd numbers located at even indices in the list.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `lst`:

- class:
    1. `lst`: is null
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty ArrayList
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only even-indexed elements that are all even numbers
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only even-indexed elements that are all odd numbers
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only odd-indexed elements that are all even numbers
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only odd-indexed elements that are all odd numbers
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains both even and odd indexed elements, some of which are odd numbers at even indices
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains both even and odd indexed elements, none of which are odd numbers at even indices
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains mixed even and odd numbers at both even and odd indices, with at least one odd number at an even index

These classes cover various scenarios including edge cases and typical use cases.
