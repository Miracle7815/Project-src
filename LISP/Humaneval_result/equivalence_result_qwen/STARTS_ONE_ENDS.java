Based on the method signature and body, the instance of `n` should be generated to test the API method, which calculates the number of n-digit numbers that start with 1 and end with 0.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.

Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `n`:

- class:
    1. `n`: is less than 1 (e.g., negative numbers or zero)
- class:
    1. `n`: is equal to 1
- class:
    1. `n`: is greater than 1 (e.g., 2, 3, 4, etc.)

This partition ensures that we cover the edge case where `n` is less than 1, the specific case where `n` equals 1, and the general case where `n` is greater than 1.
