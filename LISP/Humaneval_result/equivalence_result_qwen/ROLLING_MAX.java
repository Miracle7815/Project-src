Certainly! Let's partition the equivalence classes for the input `numbers` in the `rolling_max` method.

### Equivalence Classes for `numbers`:

1. **Class: Empty List**
   - Description: The input list `numbers` is empty.
   - Form: `numbers = []`

2. **Class: Single Element List**
   - Description: The input list `numbers` contains only one element.
   - Form: `numbers = [x]` where `x` is an integer.

3. **Class: All Elements Are Identical**
   - Description: The input list `numbers` contains multiple elements, all of which are the same.
   - Form: `numbers = [x, x, ..., x]` where `x` is an integer and there are at least two `x` values.

4. **Class: Elements in Increasing Order**
   - Description: The input list `numbers` contains elements in strictly increasing order.
   - Form: `numbers = [x1, x2, ..., xn]` where `x1 < x2 < ... < xn`.

5. **Class: Elements in Decreasing Order**
   - Description: The input list `numbers` contains elements in strictly decreasing order.
   - Form: `numbers = [x1, x2, ..., xn]` where `x1 > x2 > ... > xn`.

6. **Class: Mixed Order with Unique Elements**
   - Description: The input list `numbers` contains elements in mixed order, with all unique elements.
   - Form: `numbers = [x1, x2, ..., xn]` where `x1, x2, ..., xn` are unique integers and not in any specific order.

7. **Class: Mixed Order with Duplicates**
   - Description: The input list `numbers` contains elements in mixed order, with some duplicate elements.
   - Form: `numbers = [x1, x2, ..., xn]` where `x1, x2, ..., xn` are integers, some of which may be duplicates, and not in any specific order.

8. **Class: Large Numbers**
   - Description: The input list `numbers` contains very large integers.
   - Form: `numbers = [x1, x2, ..., xn]` where `x1, x2, ..., xn` are very large integers.

9. **Class: Small Numbers**
   - Description: The input list `numbers` contains very small integers (including negative numbers).
   - Form: `numbers = [x1, x2, ..., xn]` where `x1, x2, ..., xn` are very small integers, including negative numbers.

### Example Inputs for Each Class:

1. **Empty List**
   - Input: `[]`

2. **Single Element List**
   - Input: `[5]`

3. **All Elements Are Identical**
   - Input: `[3, 3, 3, 3]`

4. **Elements in Increasing Order**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

5. **Elements in Decreasing Order**
   - Input: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

6. **Mixed Order with Unique Elements**
   - Input: `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]`

7. **Mixed Order with Duplicates**
   - Input: `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3]`

8. **Large Numbers**
   - Input: `[1000000, 2000000, 3000000]`

9. **Small Numbers**
   - Input: `[-10, -20, -30, -40]`

These equivalence classes cover a wide range of scenarios to ensure comprehensive testing of the `rolling_max` method.
