Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `txt` should be generated to test the API method, which represents whether the last character of the string is a letter. To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.

Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `txt`:

- class:
    1. `txt`: is null
- class:
    1. `txt`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `txt`: ends with a space, and the last non-space character is a letter (e.g., "hello world a ")
- class:
    1. `txt`: ends with a space, and the last non-space character is not a letter (e.g., "hello world 1 ")
- class:
    1. `txt`: does not end with a space, and the last character is a letter (e.g., "hello world a")
- class:
    1. `txt`: does not end with a space, and the last character is not a letter (e.g., "hello world 1")
- class:
    1. `txt`: consists of a single letter (e.g., "a")
- class:
    1. `txt`: consists of a single non-letter character (e.g., "1")
- class:
    1. `txt`: consists of multiple words, but the last word is a single letter (e.g., "hello world z")
- class:
    1. `txt`: consists of multiple words, but the last word is not a single letter (e.g., "hello world abc")

Note that the current implementation of the method seems flawed as it only checks the first character of the last word/part rather than the actual last character of the entire string. The provided equivalence classes cover various scenarios to help identify such issues.
