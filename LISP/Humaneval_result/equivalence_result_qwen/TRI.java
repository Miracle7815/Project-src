Based on the method signature and body, the instance of `n` should be generated to test the API method, which generates a sequence based on specific rules.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `n`:

- class:
    1. `n`: is less than 0 (negative numbers)
- class:
    1. `n`: is equal to 0
- class:
    1. `n`: is equal to 1
- class:
    1. `n`: is greater than 1 and even
- class:
    1. `n`: is greater than 1 and odd

These partitions cover all possible cases for the input `n`, ensuring that the method is thoroughly tested.
