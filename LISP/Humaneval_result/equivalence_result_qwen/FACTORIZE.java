Sure, let's break down the possible equivalence classes for the input parameter `n` in the `factorize` method.

### Equivalence Classes:

1. **Class:**
   - `n`: is less than 2
     - This class includes values like `0`, `1`, `-1`, `-5`, etc.
     - The method should return an empty list since numbers less than 2 do not have prime factors.

2. **Class:**
   - `n`: is a prime number
     - This class includes values like `2`, `3`, `5`, `7`, `11`, etc.
     - The method should return a list containing only the number itself.

3. **Class:**
   - `n`: is a composite number with small factors
     - This class includes values like `4`, `6`, `8`, `9`, `10`, etc.
     - The method should return a list of its prime factors, e.g., `4` should return `[2, 2]`.

4. **Class:**
   - `n`: is a composite number with large factors
     - This class includes values like `100`, `143`, `169`, etc.
     - The method should return a list of its prime factors, e.g., `100` should return `[2, 2, 5, 5]`.

5. **Class:**
   - `n`: is a perfect square of a prime number
     - This class includes values like `4`, `9`, `25`, `49`, etc.
     - The method should return a list of its prime factors repeated, e.g., `9` should return `[3, 3]`.

6. **Class:**
   - `n`: is a product of multiple distinct prime numbers
     - This class includes values like `30`, `42`, `70`, etc.
     - The method should return a list of its prime factors, e.g., `30` should return `[2, 3, 5]`.

7. **Class:**
   - `n`: is a large number
     - This class includes very large values, e.g., `123456789`.
     - The method should handle large numbers efficiently and return the correct list of prime factors.

8. **Class:**
   - `n`: is the maximum integer value (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`)
     - This class includes `2147483647`.
     - The method should correctly handle the maximum integer value and return the correct list of prime factors, which in this case is `[2147483647]` since it is a prime number.

### Summary of Equivalence Classes:

- class: `n` is less than 2
- class: `n` is a prime number
- class: `n` is a composite number with small factors
- class: `n` is a composite number with large factors
- class: `n` is a perfect square of a prime number
- class: `n` is a product of multiple distinct prime numbers
- class: `n` is a large number
- class: `n` is the maximum integer value (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`)
