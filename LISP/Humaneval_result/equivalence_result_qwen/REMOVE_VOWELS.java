Sure, let's partition the equivalence classes for the `remove_vowels` method.

The method removes vowels from a given string, considering both uppercase and lowercase vowels. We need to cover various scenarios to ensure the method behaves correctly under different conditions:

- class:
    1. `string`: is null
- class:
    1. `string`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `string`: contains only vowels (both uppercase and lowercase)
- class:
    1. `string`: contains only consonants (both uppercase and lowercase)
- class:
    1. `string`: contains a mix of vowels and consonants (both uppercase and lowercase)
- class:
    1. `string`: contains special characters and numbers
- class:
    1. `string`: contains a mix of vowels, consonants, special characters, and numbers

These classes cover all possible input types and combinations that the method might encounter.
