Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `arr` should be generated to test the API method, which counts how many numbers in the list have a positive digit sum. To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `arr`:

- class:
    1. `arr`: is null

- class:
    1. `arr`: is an empty list

- class:
    1. `arr`: contains only positive numbers with a positive digit sum

- class:
    1. `arr`: contains only positive numbers with a non-positive digit sum (e.g., zero)

- class:
    1. `arr`: contains only negative numbers with a positive digit sum

- class:
    1. `arr`: contains only negative numbers with a non-positive digit sum (e.g., zero)

- class:
    1. `arr`: contains a mix of positive and negative numbers with various digit sums

- class:
    1. `arr`: contains numbers with leading zeros (though Java's Integer type does not allow leading zeros, we should still consider edge cases like "0" as a string representation)

- class:
    1. `arr`: contains very large positive and negative numbers to test potential integer overflow issues (though unlikely in this context)

These partitions aim to cover all possible scenarios that the method might encounter during execution.
