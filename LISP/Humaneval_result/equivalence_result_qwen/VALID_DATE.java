Certainly! Let's partition the equivalence classes for the `valid_date` method based on the input string `date`. We'll consider various scenarios to ensure we cover all possible edge cases and normal cases.

### Equivalence Classes:

1. **Invalid Format**:
   - class: `date` is null
   - class: `date` is an empty string
   - class: `date` does not contain exactly three parts separated by hyphens (e.g., "2021-02", "2021-02-29-01")
   - class: `date` contains non-numeric values in any part (e.g., "2021-02-ab", "xy-02-29")

2. **Invalid Month**:
   - class: `month` is less than 1 (e.g., "0-02-29")
   - class: `month` is greater than 12 (e.g., "13-02-29")

3. **Invalid Day**:
   - class: `day` is less than 1 for any month (e.g., "01-00-2021", "02-00-2021")
   - class: `day` is greater than 31 for months with 31 days (e.g., "01-32-2021", "03-32-2021")
   - class: `day` is greater than 30 for months with 30 days (e.g., "04-31-2021", "06-31-2021")
   - class: `day` is greater than 29 for February (e.g., "02-30-2021", "02-31-2021")

4. **Valid Date**:
   - class: `day` is within the valid range for months with 31 days (e.g., "01-15-2021", "07-31-2021")
   - class: `day` is within the valid range for months with 30 days (e.g., "04-15-2021", "11-30-2021")
   - class: `day` is within the valid range for February (e.g., "02-15-2021", "02-29-2020")

### Summary of Equivalence Classes:

```markdown
- class: `date` is null
- class: `date` is an empty string
- class: `date` does not contain exactly three parts separated by hyphens
- class: `date` contains non-numeric values in any part
- class: `month` is less than 1
- class: `month` is greater than 12
- class: `day` is less than 1 for any month
- class: `day` is greater than 31 for months with 31 days
- class: `day` is greater than 30 for months with 30 days
- class: `day` is greater than 29 for February
- class: `day` is within the valid range for months with 31 days
- class: `day` is within the valid range for months with 30 days
- class: `day` is within the valid range for February
```

These equivalence classes should help ensure comprehensive testing of the `valid_date` method.
