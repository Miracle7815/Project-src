Sure, let's break down the `filter_integers` method to identify the equivalence classes for the input parameter `values`.

The method iterates over a list of objects and filters out only those elements that are instances of the `Integer` class.

Here are the possible equivalence classes:

- class:
  1. `values`: is null
- class:
  1. `values`: is an empty list
- class:
  1. `values`: contains only integers
- class:
  1. `values`: contains only non-integers (e.g., strings, doubles, etc.)
- class:
  1. `values`: contains a mix of integers and non-integers

These classes cover all possible scenarios that the method might encounter during execution.
