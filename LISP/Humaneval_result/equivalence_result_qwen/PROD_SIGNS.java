Sure, let's partition the equivalence classes for the `prod_signs` method.

The method calculates the product of the signs of all elements in the array and then multiplies this product by the sum of the absolute values of the elements in the array. If the array is empty, it returns -10.

Here are the equivalence classes:

- class:
    1. `arr`: is an empty array

- class:
    1. `arr`: contains only one element, which is zero

- class:
    1. `arr`: contains only one element, which is positive

- class:
    1. `arr`: contains only one element, which is negative

- class:
    1. `arr`: contains multiple elements, including zeros, positives, and negatives, and the overall product of signs is positive

- class:
    1. `arr`: contains multiple elements, including zeros, positives, and negatives, and the overall product of signs is negative

- class:
    1. `arr`: contains multiple elements, all of which are positive

- class:
    1. `arr`: contains multiple elements, all of which are negative

- class:
    1. `arr`: contains multiple elements, all of which are zeros

These classes cover different scenarios for the input array, ensuring that all possible conditions within the method are tested.
