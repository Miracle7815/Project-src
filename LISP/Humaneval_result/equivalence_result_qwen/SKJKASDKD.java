Certainly! We need to consider various scenarios for the input array `lst` to ensure comprehensive testing of the `skjkasdkd` method. Here's how we can partition the equivalence classes:

### Equivalence Classes for `lst`:

1. **Empty Array**:
   - `lst`: is an empty array `[]`.

2. **Array with No Prime Numbers**:
   - `lst`: contains only non-prime numbers, e.g., `[4, 6, 8, 9, 10]`.

3. **Array with One Prime Number**:
   - `lst`: contains exactly one prime number, e.g., `[4, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.

4. **Array with Multiple Prime Numbers**:
   - `lst`: contains multiple prime numbers, e.g., `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11]`.

5. **Array with All Elements Being the Same Prime Number**:
   - `lst`: contains all elements as the same prime number, e.g., `[3, 3, 3, 3]`.

6. **Array with All Elements Being the Same Non-Prime Number**:
   - `lst`: contains all elements as the same non-prime number, e.g., `[4, 4, 4, 4]`.

7. **Array with Negative Numbers**:
   - `lst`: contains negative numbers, e.g., `[-3, -2, 5, 7]`.

8. **Array with Zero and One**:
   - `lst`: contains zero and/or one, e.g., `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.

9. **Array with Large Numbers**:
   - `lst`: contains large numbers, e.g., `[1000003, 1000007, 1000009]`.

10. **Array with Mixed Positive and Negative Numbers**:
    - `lst`: contains a mix of positive and negative numbers, e.g., `[-1, 2, -3, 5, 7]`.

### Example Partitioning:

```plaintext
- class: lst is an empty array
    - lst: []

- class: lst contains only non-prime numbers
    - lst: [4, 6, 8, 9, 10]

- class: lst contains exactly one prime number
    - lst: [4, 6, 7, 8, 9]

- class: lst contains multiple prime numbers
    - lst: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

- class: lst contains all elements as the same prime number
    - lst: [3, 3, 3, 3]

- class: lst contains all elements as the same non-prime number
    - lst: [4, 4, 4, 4]

- class: lst contains negative numbers
    - lst: [-3, -2, 5, 7]

- class: lst contains zero and/or one
    - lst: [0, 1, 2, 3]

- class: lst contains large numbers
    - lst: [1000003, 1000007, 1000009]

- class: lst contains a mix of positive and negative numbers
    - lst: [-1, 2, -3, 5, 7]
```

Each of these classes will help ensure that the method is tested under various conditions, covering edge cases and typical scenarios.
