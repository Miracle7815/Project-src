Sure, let's analyze the `sort_array_binary` method and partition the equivalence classes for the input `arr`.

The method sorts an `ArrayList<Integer>` based on the number of ones in their binary representation. If two numbers have the same number of ones, they are sorted by their natural order.

### Equivalence Classes for `arr`:

1. **Class:**
   - `arr`: is null
   - Reason: To check how the method handles a null input.

2. **Class:**
   - `arr`: is an empty list (`new ArrayList<Integer>()`)
   - Reason: To check how the method handles an empty list.

3. **Class:**
   - `arr`: contains only one element (e.g., `[5]`)
   - Reason: To check if the method correctly handles a single-element list.

4. **Class:**
   - `arr`: contains multiple elements with the same number of ones in their binary representation (e.g., `[3, 5, 6]` because 3 and 5 both have 2 ones)
   - Reason: To check if the method correctly sorts elements with the same number of ones by their natural order.

5. **Class:**
   - `arr`: contains multiple elements with different numbers of ones in their binary representation (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`)
   - Reason: To check if the method correctly sorts elements based on the number of ones in their binary representation.

6. **Class:**
   - `arr`: contains negative numbers (e.g., `[-1, -2, -3, -4]`)
   - Reason: To check how the method handles negative numbers, as the `number_ones` function takes the absolute value of the input.

7. **Class:**
   - `arr`: contains a mix of positive and negative numbers (e.g., `[-1, 1, -2, 2, -3, 3]`)
   - Reason: To check if the method correctly handles a mix of positive and negative numbers.

8. **Class:**
   - `arr`: contains very large numbers (e.g., `[Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE]`)
   - Reason: To check the behavior of the method with very large numbers.

Here is the structured answer:

- class: `arr` is null
- class: `arr` is an empty list
- class: `arr` contains only one element
- class: `arr` contains multiple elements with the same number of ones in their binary representation
- class: `arr` contains multiple elements with different numbers of ones in their binary representation
- class: `arr` contains negative numbers
- class: `arr` contains a mix of positive and negative numbers
- class: `arr` contains very large numbers
