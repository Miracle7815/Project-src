Sure, let's partition the equivalence classes for the `fib` method. This method calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive approach.

Here are the equivalence classes:

- class:
    1. `n`: is less than 0 (invalid input, as Fibonacci numbers are defined for non-negative integers)

- class:
    1. `n`: is 0 (base case, returns 0)

- class:
    1. `n`: is 1 (base case, returns 1)

- class:
    1. `n`: is 2 (returns 1, as the third Fibonacci number is 1)

- class:
    1. `n`: is greater than 2 and even (general case, returns the nth Fibonacci number)

- class:
    1. `n`: is greater than 2 and odd (general case, returns the nth Fibonacci number)

These partitions cover all possible scenarios for the input `n` when calling the `fib` method. Note that while the function does not explicitly handle negative values, it would result in a stack overflow due to infinite recursion, so it's good to include it as an invalid input case.
