Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `x` should be generated to test the API method, which filters a list of integers to include only those numbers whose digits are all odd, then sorts the resulting list.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `x`:

- class:
  1. `x`: is null
- class:
  1. `x`: is an empty list
- class:
  1. `x`: contains only numbers with all odd digits
- class:
  1. `x`: contains only numbers with at least one even digit
- class:
  1. `x`: contains a mix of numbers with all odd digits and numbers with at least one even digit
- class:
  1. `x`: contains negative numbers with all odd digits
- class:
  1. `x`: contains negative numbers with at least one even digit
- class:
  1. `x`: contains a mix of positive and negative numbers, some with all odd digits and some with at least one even digit
- class:
  1. `x`: contains duplicate numbers with all odd digits
- class:
  1. `x`: contains duplicate numbers with at least one even digit
- class:
  1. `x`: contains duplicate numbers, some with all odd digits and some with at least one even digit

These partitions cover various scenarios including edge cases such as null input, empty lists, and mixed lists with positive and negative numbers.
