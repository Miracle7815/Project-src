Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `music_string` should be generated to test the API method, which represents parsing a music string into a list of integers based on predefined note mappings.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `music_string`:

- class:
    1. `music_string`: is null
- class:
    1. `music_string`: is an empty string (after trimming)
- class:
    1. `music_string`: contains only whitespace characters
- class:
    1. `music_string`: contains valid notes separated by spaces, all of which are in the `note_map` ("o", "o|", ".|")
- class:
    1. `music_string`: contains valid notes separated by spaces, some of which are in the `note_map` and some are not
- class:
    1. `music_string`: contains invalid notes separated by spaces (none of which are in the `note_map`)
- class:
    1. `music_string`: contains mixed valid and invalid notes separated by spaces

These partitions will help ensure that the method handles various edge cases and typical scenarios correctly.
