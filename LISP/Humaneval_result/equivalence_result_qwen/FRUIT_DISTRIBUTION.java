Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `s` and `n` should be generated to test the API method, which calculates the remaining number of fruits after distributing some based on the numbers mentioned in the input string.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.

Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `s` and `n`:

- class:
    1. `s`: is null; 2. `n`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `s`: is an empty string; 2. `n`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `s`: contains only non-numeric characters; 2. `n`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `s`: contains only numeric characters separated by spaces; 2. `n`: can be any integer such that the sum of the numbers in `s` is less than `n`
- class:
    1. `s`: contains only numeric characters separated by spaces; 2. `n`: can be any integer such that the sum of the numbers in `s` is equal to `n`
- class:
    1. `s`: contains only numeric characters separated by spaces; 2. `n`: can be any integer such that the sum of the numbers in `s` is greater than `n`
- class:
    1. `s`: contains both numeric and non-numeric characters; 2. `n`: can be any integer such that the sum of the numbers in `s` is less than `n`
- class:
    1. `s`: contains both numeric and non-numeric characters; 2. `n`: can be any integer such that the sum of the numbers in `s` is equal to `n`
- class:
    1. `s`: contains both numeric and non-numeric characters; 2. `n`: can be any integer such that the sum of the numbers in `s` is greater than `n`
