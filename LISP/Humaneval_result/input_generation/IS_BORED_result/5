Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. We need to create instances of the `S` string containing multiple sentences, some starting with "I " and some not starting with "I ".

Here is an example of how we can write test cases for the `is_bored` method:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class IS_BOREDTest {

    @Test
    public void testIsBored_WithSentencesStartingWithI() {
        String S = "I am bored. I need a break. I want to go out.";
        int result = IS_BORED.is_bored(S);
        assertEquals(3, result);
    }

    @Test
    public void testIsBored_WithSentencesNotStartingWithI() {
        String S = "The weather is nice. Going for a walk. I am hungry.";
        int result = IS_BORED.is_bored(S);
        assertEquals(1, result);
    }

    @Test
    public void testIsBored_WithEmptyString() {
        String S = "";
        int result = IS_BORED.is_bored(S);
        assertEquals(0, result);
    }
}
```

In the above test cases, we are testing the `is_bored` method with different scenarios - sentences starting with "I ", sentences not starting with "I ", and an empty string.
