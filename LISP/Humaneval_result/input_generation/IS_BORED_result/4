Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. We need to create instances of the `S` string that contains multiple sentences, all starting with "I ".

Here is an example of how we can write test cases for the `is_bored` method:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class IS_BOREDTest {

    @Test
    public void testIsBored_WithSingleSentence() {
        String S = "I am bored. I need some entertainment.";
        int result = IS_BORED.is_bored(S);
        assertEquals(1, result);
    }

    @Test
    public void testIsBored_WithMultipleSentences() {
        String S = "I am bored. I want to go out. I need a break.";
        int result = IS_BORED.is_bored(S);
        assertEquals(3, result);
    }

    @Test
    public void testIsBored_WithNoMatchingSentences() {
        String S = "The weather is nice today. I have a lot of work to do.";
        int result = IS_BORED.is_bored(S);
        assertEquals(0, result);
    }
}
```

In the above test cases, we are testing the `is_bored` method with different scenarios - a single sentence, multiple sentences, and no matching sentences.
