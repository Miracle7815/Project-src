Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. Here is an example of how to write test cases for the `is_bored` method:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class IS_BOREDTest {

    @Test
    public void testIsBored_WithSentencesStartingWithI() {
        String S = "I am bored. I need a break. I want to relax.";
        int result = IS_BORED.is_bored(S);
        assertEquals(3, result);
    }

    @Test
    public void testIsBored_WithSentencesNotStartingWithI() {
        String S = "The weather is nice. Going for a walk.";
        int result = IS_BORED.is_bored(S);
        assertEquals(0, result);
    }

    @Test
    public void testIsBored_WithMixedSentences() {
        String S = "I am tired. The day is long. I need a break.";
        int result = IS_BORED.is_bored(S);
        assertEquals(2, result);
    }
}
```

In the above test cases, we are testing the `is_bored` method with different types of input strings to cover the scenarios where some sentences start with "I " and some do not.
