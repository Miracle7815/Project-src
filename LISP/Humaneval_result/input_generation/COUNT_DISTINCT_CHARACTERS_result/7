Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. We need to create instances of the `string` input containing non-English characters or symbols.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_COUNT_DISTINCT_CHARACTERS {
    
    @Test
    public void testCountDistinctCharacters_1() {
        String string = "Hello, 你好, こんにちは, привет!";
        int result = COUNT_DISTINCT_CHARACTERS.count_distinct_characters(string);
        assertEquals(17, result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testCountDistinctCharacters_2() {
        String string = "Testing with symbols: !@#$%^&*()_+";
        int result = COUNT_DISTINCT_CHARACTERS.count_distinct_characters(string);
        assertEquals(16, result);
    }
}
```

In the above code:
- We import the necessary JUnit classes for testing.
- We create two test cases with different strings containing non-English characters and symbols.
- We call the `count_distinct_characters` method from the `COUNT_DISTINCT_CHARACTERS` class with the test strings.
- We use `assertEquals` to verify that the method returns the expected number of distinct characters for each input string.
