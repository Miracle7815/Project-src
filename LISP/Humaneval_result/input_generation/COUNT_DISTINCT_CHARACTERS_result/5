Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. We need to create instances of the `string` input that contains uppercase and lowercase versions of the same character.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_COUNT_DISTINCT_CHARACTERS {
    
    @Test
    public void testCountDistinctCharacters_1() {
        String inputString = "aAaAaA";
        int result = COUNT_DISTINCT_CHARACTERS.count_distinct_characters(inputString);
        assertEquals(1, result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testCountDistinctCharacters_2() {
        String inputString = "AbCdEfG";
        int result = COUNT_DISTINCT_CHARACTERS.count_distinct_characters(inputString);
        assertEquals(7, result);
    }
}
```

In the above code:
- We import the necessary JUnit classes for testing.
- We create two test cases to cover scenarios where the input string contains uppercase and lowercase versions of the same character.
- We call the `count_distinct_characters` method with the input strings and assert the expected results using `assertEquals`.

These test cases will help ensure that the `count_distinct_characters` method behaves as expected for inputs containing uppercase and lowercase versions of the same character.
