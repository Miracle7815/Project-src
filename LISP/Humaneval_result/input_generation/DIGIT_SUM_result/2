Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_DIGIT_SUM {
    
    @Test
    public void testEmptyString() {
        String s = "";
        int result = DIGIT_SUM.digit_sum(s);
        assertEquals(0, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `digit_sum` method with an empty string as input, as specified in the input specification. The expected result is 0 since there are no characters in an empty string.
