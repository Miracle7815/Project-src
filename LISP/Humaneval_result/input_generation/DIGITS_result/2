Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases to cover the scenario where the input integer `n` has no odd digits. We will test the `digits` method with such inputs to ensure it returns 0 as expected.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_DIGITS {
    
    @Test
    public void testNoOddDigits() {
        int n = 24680;
        int result = DIGITS.digits(n);
        assertEquals(0, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are passing the integer `24680` to the `digits` method, which does not contain any odd digits. The expected result is `0`, as mentioned in the input specification.
