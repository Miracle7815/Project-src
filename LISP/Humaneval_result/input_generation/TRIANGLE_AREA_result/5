Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write the test inputs in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;

public class Test_TRIANGLE_AREA {
    
    @Test
    public void testTriangleArea() {
        double a = 5.0;
        double h = -3.0;
        double expectedArea = -7.5; // Expected area when h is negative
        double actualArea = TRIANGLE_AREA.triangle_area(a, h);
        assertEquals(expectedArea, actualArea, 0.0001);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `triangle_area` method of the `TRIANGLE_AREA` class with a positive value for `a` and a negative value for `h`. The expected area is calculated based on the formula provided in the method.
