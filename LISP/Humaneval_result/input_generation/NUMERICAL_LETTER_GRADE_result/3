Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertArrayEquals;

public class Test_NUMERICAL_LETTER_GRADE {

    @Test
    public void testNumericalLetterGrade() {
        double[] grades = {4.0};
        String[] expected = {"A+"};
        String[] result = NUMERICAL_LETTER_GRADE.numerical_letter_grade(grades);
        assertArrayEquals(expected, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `numerical_letter_grade` method with an input array containing a single element equal to 4.0. The expected output is an array with a single element "A+". The `assertArrayEquals` method is used to compare the expected and actual results.
