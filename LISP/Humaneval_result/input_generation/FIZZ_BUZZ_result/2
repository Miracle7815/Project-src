Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class TestFIZZ_BUZZ {
    
    @Test
    public void testFizzBuzzWithZero() {
        int result = FIZZ_BUZZ.fizz_buzz(0);
        assertEquals(0, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `fizz_buzz` method of the `FIZZ_BUZZ` class with input `n` as 0. The expected result is 0.
