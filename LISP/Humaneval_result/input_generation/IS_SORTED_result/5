Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format to test the `is_sorted` method. 

Here is the code to instantiate the objects and the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class Test_IS_SORTED {

    @Test
    public void testDescendingOrder() {
        int[] lst = {5, 3}; // Contains two elements in descending order
        boolean result = IS_SORTED.is_sorted(lst);
        assertFalse(result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the scenario where the input array `lst` contains two elements in descending order. The expected behavior is that the method should return `false` since the array is not sorted.
