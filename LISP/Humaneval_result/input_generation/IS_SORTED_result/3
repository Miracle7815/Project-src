Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class Test_IS_SORTED {

    @Test
    public void testIsSorted_singleElement() {
        int[] lst = {5};
        boolean result = IS_SORTED.is_sorted(lst);
        assertTrue(result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `is_sorted` method with an input array `lst` that contains only one element. The expected behavior is that the method should return `true` since a single element array is always considered sorted.
