Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. We need to create instances of `s` which contains special characters or numbers.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_COUNT_UPPER {
    
    @Test
    public void testCount_upper_WithSpecialCharacters() {
        String s = "H@llo W0rld!";
        int result = COUNT_UPPER.count_upper(s);
        assertEquals(2, result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testCount_upper_WithNumbers() {
        String s = "12345";
        int result = COUNT_UPPER.count_upper(s);
        assertEquals(2, result);
    }
}
```

In the above code:
- We import the necessary JUnit classes for testing.
- We create two test cases, one with special characters and one with numbers in the input string `s`.
- We call the `count_upper` method from the `COUNT_UPPER` class with the test input `s`.
- We use `assertEquals` to verify that the actual result matches the expected result for each test case.
