Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_COUNT_UPPER {
    
    @Test
    public void testCount_upper_1() {
        String s = "AEIOU";
        int result = COUNT_UPPER.count_upper(s);
        assertEquals(5, result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testCount_upper_2() {
        String s = "UUUUU";
        int result = COUNT_UPPER.count_upper(s);
        assertEquals(5, result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testCount_upper_3() {
        String s = "AEIOUAEIOU";
        int result = COUNT_UPPER.count_upper(s);
        assertEquals(10, result);
    }
}
```

In the above test cases, we are testing the `count_upper` method with different inputs that contain only uppercase vowels as specified in the input specification.
