Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_COUNT_UPPER {
    
    @Test
    public void testCountUpper_NullString() {
        String s = null;
        int result = COUNT_UPPER.count_upper(s);
        assertEquals(0, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `count_upper` method with a `null` string as input, as specified in the input specification. The expected result is `0` since there are no uppercase vowels in a `null` string.
