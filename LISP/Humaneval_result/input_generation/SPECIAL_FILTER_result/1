Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class SPECIAL_FILTERTest {

    @Test
    public void testSpecialFilter_emptyArray() {
        int[] nums = {};
        int result = SPECIAL_FILTER.special_filter(nums);
        assertEquals(0, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `special_filter` method with an empty array as input. The expected result is 0 since there are no elements in the array to check for the special condition.
