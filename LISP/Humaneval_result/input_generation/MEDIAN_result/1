Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_MEDIAN {

    @Test
    public void testMedian_NullList() {
        int[] list = null;
        double result = MEDIAN.median(list);
        assertEquals(Double.NaN, result, 0.001);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `median` method with a `null` list as input. The expected result is `Double.NaN` as the method should handle a `null` list gracefully.
