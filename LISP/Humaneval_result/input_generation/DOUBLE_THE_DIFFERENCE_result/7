Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format. We need to create instances of `lst` which contains a mix of positive and negative integer double values.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_DOUBLE_THE_DIFFERENCE {

    @Test
    public void test_double_the_difference_1() {
        double[] lst = {1.0, -2.5, 3.0, -4.5, 5.0};
        int result = DOUBLE_THE_DIFFERENCE.double_the_difference(lst);
        assertEquals(35, result);
    }

    @Test
    public void test_double_the_difference_2() {
        double[] lst = {2.5, -3.0, 4.5, -5.0, 6.0};
        int result = DOUBLE_THE_DIFFERENCE.double_the_difference(lst);
        assertEquals(0, result);
    }
}
```

In the above test cases, we are testing the `double_the_difference` method with different input arrays containing a mix of positive and negative integer double values. The expected results are provided based on the logic inside the method.
