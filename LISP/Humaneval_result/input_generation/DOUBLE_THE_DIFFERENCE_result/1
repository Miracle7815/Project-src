Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_DOUBLE_THE_DIFFERENCE {

    @Test
    public void testEmptyArray() {
        double[] lst = new double[]{};
        int result = DOUBLE_THE_DIFFERENCE.double_the_difference(lst);
        assertEquals(0, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the scenario where the input array `lst` is empty. The expected result is 0 as there are no elements in the array to process.
