Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_DOUBLE_THE_DIFFERENCE {

    @Test
    public void testDoubleTheDifference1() {
        double[] lst = {1.0, 2.5, -3.0, 4.0, -5.5};
        assertEquals(1, DOUBLE_THE_DIFFERENCE.double_the_difference(lst));
    }

    @Test
    public void testDoubleTheDifference2() {
        double[] lst = {2.0, -3.5, 4.0, -5.0, 6.5};
        assertEquals(4, DOUBLE_THE_DIFFERENCE.double_the_difference(lst));
    }
}
```

In the above test cases, we are testing the `double_the_difference` method with different input arrays containing a mix of positive and negative integer double values, including odd and even numbers. The expected results are provided based on the logic implemented in the `double_the_difference` method.
