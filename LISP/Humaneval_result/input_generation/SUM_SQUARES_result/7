Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. We need to create instances of `lst` which contains positive numbers.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_SUM_SQUARES {
    
    @Test
    public void test_sum_squares_1() {
        int[] lst = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int result = SUM_SQUARES.sum_squares(lst);
        assertEquals(55, result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void test_sum_squares_2() {
        int[] lst = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
        int result = SUM_SQUARES.sum_squares(lst);
        assertEquals(54, result);
    }
}
```

In the above code, we have created two test cases with different input arrays containing positive numbers. The expected results are calculated manually based on the provided logic in the `sum_squares` method.
