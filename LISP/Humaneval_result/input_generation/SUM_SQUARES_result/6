Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_SUM_SQUARES {

    @Test
    public void testEmptyList() {
        int[] lst = {};
        int result = SUM_SQUARES.sum_squares(lst);
        assertEquals(0, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `sum_squares` method with an empty list as input, which is in line with the input specification provided.
