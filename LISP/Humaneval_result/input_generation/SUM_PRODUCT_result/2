Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertArrayEquals;

public class Test_SUM_PRODUCT {
    
    @Test
    public void testSumProduct_singleElement() {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(5);
        Integer[] expected = {5, 5};
        Integer[] result = SUM_PRODUCT.sum_product(numbers);
        assertArrayEquals(expected, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `sum_product` method with a list containing a single element, which is 5. The expected result is an array containing the sum and product of the single element, which is {5, 5}.
