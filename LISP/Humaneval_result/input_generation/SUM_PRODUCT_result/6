Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. Here is the code to instantiate the objects and the required import statements:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class SUM_PRODUCTTest {

    @Test
    public void testSumProductWithZero() {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(2, 3, 0, 5);
        Integer[] expected = {10, 0};
        Integer[] result = SUM_PRODUCT.sum_product(numbers);
        assertArrayEquals(expected, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `sum_product` method with a list of integers that contains zero as an element. The expected result is an array containing the sum and product of all the numbers in the list.
