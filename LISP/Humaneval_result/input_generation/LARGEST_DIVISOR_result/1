Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. We need to create instances of `n`, which is a prime number, and test the `largest_divisor` method.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import org.junit.Test;

public class TestLARGEST_DIVISOR {

    @Test
    public void testLargestDivisor_PrimeNumber() {
        int n = 17; // Prime number
        int result = LARGEST_DIVISOR.largest_divisor(n);
        assertEquals(1, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `largest_divisor` method with a prime number `n = 17`. The expected result is `1` since prime numbers only have 1 and the number itself as divisors.
