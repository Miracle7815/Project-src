Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. Here is the code to instantiate the object and the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class Test_CORRECT_BRACKETING {

    @Test
    public void testCorrectBracketing_1() {
        String brackets = "<><><>";
        assertTrue(CORRECT_BRACKETING.correct_bracketing(brackets));
    }

    @Test
    public void testCorrectBracketing_2() {
        String brackets = "<<<<>>>>";
        assertFalse(CORRECT_BRACKETING.correct_bracketing(brackets));
    }

    @Test
    public void testCorrectBracketing_3() {
        String brackets = "<><<>>";
        assertFalse(CORRECT_BRACKETING.correct_bracketing(brackets));
    }
}
``` 

In the above code, we have imported the necessary JUnit classes and written test cases to test the `correct_bracketing` method of the `CORRECT_BRACKETING` class. The test cases cover scenarios with balanced and unbalanced brackets as per the input specification.
