Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. We need to create instances of `numbers` containing multiple words representing numbers with some duplicates.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_SORT_NUMBERS {
    
    @Test
    public void testSortNumbers_1() {
        String numbers = "one two three four five five six seven eight nine";
        String sortedNumbers = SORT_NUMBERS.sort_numbers(numbers);
        assertEquals("one two three four five five six seven eight nine", sortedNumbers);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testSortNumbers_2() {
        String numbers = "three two one four four five six seven eight nine";
        String sortedNumbers = SORT_NUMBERS.sort_numbers(numbers);
        assertEquals("one two three four four five six seven eight nine", sortedNumbers);
    }
}
```

In the above test cases, we are testing the `sort_numbers` method with different inputs containing multiple words representing numbers with some duplicates. The expected output is the sorted list of numbers without duplicates.
