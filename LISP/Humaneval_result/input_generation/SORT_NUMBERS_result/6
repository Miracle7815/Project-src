Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. We need to create instances of `numbers` which contain multiple words representing numbers not in ascending or descending order.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_SORT_NUMBERS {
    
    @Test
    public void testSortNumbers_1() {
        String numbers = "five two seven four one three six nine eight";
        String sortedNumbers = SORT_NUMBERS.sort_numbers(numbers);
        assertEquals("one two three four five six seven eight nine", sortedNumbers);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testSortNumbers_2() {
        String numbers = "three seven one five nine two eight four six";
        String sortedNumbers = SORT_NUMBERS.sort_numbers(numbers);
        assertEquals("one two three four five six seven eight nine", sortedNumbers);
    }
}
```

In the above code, we have created two test cases to test the `sort_numbers` method with different inputs. The test cases verify if the method correctly sorts the numbers in the input string.
