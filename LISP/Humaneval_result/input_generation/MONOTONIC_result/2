Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format. 

First, we need to import the required classes and packages for testing:

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Test;
```

Now, we can write the test cases for the `monotonic` method:

```java
public class TestMONOTONIC {

    @Test
    public void testEmptyArray() {
        int[] l = new int[]{};
        assertTrue(MONOTONIC.monotonic(l));
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `monotonic` method with an empty array as input. The expected behavior is that the method should return `true` since an empty array is considered both sorted and reverse sorted.
