Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. We need to create instances of the array `l` with strictly increasing sequences and test the `monotonic` method.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertFalse;
import org.junit.Test;

public class TestMONOTONIC {
    
    @Test
    public void testMonotonicStrictlyIncreasing() {
        int[] l = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        assertTrue(MONOTONIC.monotonic(l));
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testMonotonicNonStrictlyIncreasing() {
        int[] l = {1, 3, 2, 4, 5};
        assertFalse(MONOTONIC.monotonic(l));
    }
}
```

In the above code:
- The first test case `testMonotonicStrictlyIncreasing` tests the `monotonic` method with an array that has a strictly increasing sequence. It expects the method to return `true`.
- The second test case `testMonotonicNonStrictlyIncreasing` tests the `monotonic` method with an array that does not have a strictly increasing sequence. It expects the method to return `false`.

Make sure to have the `MONOTONIC` class and the JUnit library in the classpath when running these tests.
