Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class TestFACTORIAL {
    
    @Test
    public void testFactorialWithZero() {
        int n = 0;
        ArrayList<Integer> expected = new ArrayList<>();
        ArrayList<Integer> result = FACTORIAL.factorial(n);
        assertEquals(expected, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `factorial` method with input `n` as 0. The expected result is an empty ArrayList since the loop will not execute for `n = 0`.
