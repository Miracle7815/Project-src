Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class SOLVE_Test {
    
    @Test
    public void testSolveWithZero() {
        int N = 0;
        String result = SOLVE.solve(N);
        assertEquals("0", result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `solve` method of the `SOLVE` class with the input value of zero. The expected output for this test case is "0".
