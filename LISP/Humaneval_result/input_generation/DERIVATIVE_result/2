Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class DERIVATIVE_Test {

    @Test
    public void testDerivative_singleElementList() {
        List<Integer> xs = new ArrayList<>();
        xs.add(5);
        
        List<Integer> expected = new ArrayList<>();
        expected.add(0); // Derivative of a constant is 0
        
        List<Integer> result = DERIVATIVE.derivative(xs);
        
        assertEquals(expected, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `derivative` method of the `DERIVATIVE` class with a single-element list as input. The expected result is a list containing a single element with value 0, as the derivative of a constant is 0.
