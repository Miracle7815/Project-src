Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class DERIVATIVE_Test {

    @Test
    public void testDerivative_emptyList() {
        List<Integer> xs = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> result = DERIVATIVE.derivative(xs);
        assertTrue(result.isEmpty());
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `derivative` method with an empty list as input. The expected behavior is that the method should return an empty list.
