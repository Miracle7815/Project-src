Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import org.junit.Test;

public class NEXT_SMALLESTTest {

    @Test
    public void testNextSmallest_emptyArray() {
        int[] lst = new int[]{};
        Integer result = NEXT_SMALLEST.next_smallest(lst);
        assertEquals(null, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `next_smallest` method with an empty array as input, as specified in the input specification. The expected result is `null` since the array is empty.
