Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import org.junit.Test;

public class Test_NEXT_SMALLEST {
    
    @Test
    public void testNextSmallest_NoSecondSmallest() {
        int[] lst = {5, 5, 5, 5, 5};
        Integer result = NEXT_SMALLEST.next_smallest(lst);
        assertEquals(null, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the scenario where the input array `lst` contains multiple elements without duplicates and all elements are the same. The expected result is `null` as there is no second smallest element in the array.
