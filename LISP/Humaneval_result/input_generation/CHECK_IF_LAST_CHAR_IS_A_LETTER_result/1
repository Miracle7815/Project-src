Based on the provided method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class CHECK_IF_LAST_CHAR_IS_A_LETTER_Test {

    @Test
    public void testEmptyString() {
        assertTrue(CHECK_IF_LAST_CHAR_IS_A_LETTER.check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""));
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the method `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` with an empty string as input, and we expect the method to return `true` since the last character of an empty string is considered a letter based on the implementation.
