Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class TRIPLES_SUM_TO_ZERO_Test {

    @Test
    public void testEmptyArray() {
        int[] numbers = new int[]{};
        assertFalse(TRIPLES_SUM_TO_ZERO.triples_sum_to_zero(numbers));
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the scenario where the input array is empty. The expected behavior is that the method should return `false` since there are no elements in the array to form a triple that sums to zero.
