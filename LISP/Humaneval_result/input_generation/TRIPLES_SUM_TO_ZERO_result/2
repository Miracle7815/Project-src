Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class Test_TRIPLES_SUM_TO_ZERO {

    @Test
    public void testTriplesSumToZero_singleElement() {
        int[] numbers = {0};
        assertTrue(TRIPLES_SUM_TO_ZERO.triples_sum_to_zero(numbers));
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `TRIPLES_SUM_TO_ZERO` method with an input array containing only one element, which is 0. The expected behavior is that the method should return `true` since there is a triple (0, 0, 0) that sums up to zero.
