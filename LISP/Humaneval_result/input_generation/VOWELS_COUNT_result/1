Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class TestVowelsCount {

    @Test
    public void testEmptyString() {
        String str = "";
        int result = VOWELS_COUNT.vowels_count(str);
        assertEquals(0, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `vowels_count` method with an empty string as input, and we expect the result to be 0 since there are no vowels in an empty string.
