Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. 

Here is the code to instantiate the objects and the required import statements:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class TestSOLUTION {
    
    @Test
    public void testEmptyList() {
        ArrayList<Integer> lst = new ArrayList<>();
        int result = SOLUTION.solution(lst);
        assertEquals(0, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `solution` method with an empty list as input. The expected result is 0 since there are no elements in the list that satisfy the given condition.
