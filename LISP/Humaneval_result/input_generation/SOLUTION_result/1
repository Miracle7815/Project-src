Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class SOLUTIONTest {

    @Test
    public void testSolution_NullList() {
        ArrayList<Integer> lst = null;
        int result = SOLUTION.solution(lst);
        assertEquals(0, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `solution` method with a `null` list as input, as specified in the input specification. The expected result is 0.
