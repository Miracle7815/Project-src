Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write a JUnit test case to test the `add` method in the `ADD` class. Here is the code snippet for the test case:

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import org.junit.Test;

public class TestADD {
    
    @Test
    public void testAdd() {
        int x = -5;
        int y = 10;
        int result = ADD.add(x, y);
        assertEquals(5, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `add` method with a negative value for `x` and a positive value for `y`. The expected result is the sum of `x` and `y`, which is 5 in this case.
