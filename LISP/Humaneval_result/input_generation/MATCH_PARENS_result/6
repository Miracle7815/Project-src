Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. 

Here is the code to instantiate the objects and the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_MATCH_PARENS {
    
    @Test
    public void testMatchParens_1() {
        String[] lst = {"(", ")"};
        String result = MATCH_PARENS.match_parens(lst);
        assertEquals("No", result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testMatchParens_2() {
        String[] lst = {")", "("};
        String result = MATCH_PARENS.match_parens(lst);
        assertEquals("Yes", result);
    }
}
``` 

In the above code:
- We import the necessary JUnit classes for testing.
- We create two test cases to cover the scenarios mentioned in the input specification.
- In the first test case, we provide an unbalanced string with more ")" than "(", and we expect the result to be "No".
- In the second test case, we provide a different unbalanced string, and we expect the result to be "Yes".
