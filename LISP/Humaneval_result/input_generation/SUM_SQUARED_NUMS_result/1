Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_SUM_SQUARED_NUMS {

    @Test
    public void testEmptyArray() {
        double[] lst = new double[]{};
        long result = SUM_SQUARED_NUMS.sum_squared_nums(lst);
        assertEquals(0, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `sum_squared_nums` method with an empty array as input, as specified in the input specification. The expected result is 0 since the sum of squares of elements in an empty array should be 0.
