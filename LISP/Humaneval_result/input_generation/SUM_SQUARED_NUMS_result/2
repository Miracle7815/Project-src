Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_SUM_SQUARED_NUMS {

    @Test
    public void testSumSquaredNums_singleElement() {
        double[] lst = {5.0};
        long result = SUM_SQUARED_NUMS.sum_squared_nums(lst);
        assertEquals(25, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `sum_squared_nums` method with a single element array `[5.0]`. The expected result is 25, as the method calculates the sum of squared numbers for each element in the array.
