Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. We need to create instances of `sentence` which contains words with a length of 2.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_WORDS_IN_SENTENCE {
    
    @Test
    public void testWordsInSentence() {
        String sentence = "He is on it";
        String result = WORDS_IN_SENTENCE.words_in_sentence(sentence);
        assertEquals("is on", result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testWordsInSentence2() {
        String sentence = "Go to bed";
        String result = WORDS_IN_SENTENCE.words_in_sentence(sentence);
        assertEquals("Go to", result);
    }
}
```

In the above code:
- We import the necessary JUnit classes for testing.
- We create two test cases with different sentences containing words with a length of 2.
- We call the `words_in_sentence` method from the `WORDS_IN_SENTENCE` class with the given sentences.
- We use `assertEquals` to verify that the output matches the expected result.
