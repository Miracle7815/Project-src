Based on the provided method and input specification, we can write test cases to cover the scenario where the input `text` contains only spaces. We will need to create instances of `text` containing only spaces and verify the output of the `fix_spaces` method.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_FIX_SPACES {
    
    @Test
    public void testFixSpaces_OnlySpaces() {
        String text = "    ";
        String result = FIX_SPACES.fix_spaces(text);
        assertEquals("____", result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are passing a string `text` containing only spaces to the `fix_spaces` method and asserting that the output should be a string with underscores replacing the spaces.
