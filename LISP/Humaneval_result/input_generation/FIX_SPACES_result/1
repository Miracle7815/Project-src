Based on the provided method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. We need to create an instance of the `FIX_SPACES` class and test the `fix_spaces` method with an empty string as input.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_FIX_SPACES {
    
    @Test
    public void testFixSpacesWithEmptyString() {
        FIX_SPACES fixer = new FIX_SPACES();
        String result = fixer.fix_spaces("");
        assertEquals("", result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `fix_spaces` method of the `FIX_SPACES` class with an empty string as input. The expected output is also an empty string.
