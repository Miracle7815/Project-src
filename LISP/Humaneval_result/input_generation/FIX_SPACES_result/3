Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class FIX_SPACES_Test {

    @Test
    public void testFixSpaces_singleCharacter() {
        String text = "a";
        String result = FIX_SPACES.fix_spaces(text);
        assertEquals("_", result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `fix_spaces` method with a single character input "a". The expected output is "_", as per the provided logic in the method.
