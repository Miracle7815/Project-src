Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format to test the `odd_count` method. 

Here is the code to instantiate the objects and the required import statements:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Test_ODD_COUNT {
    
    @Test
    public void testOddCount_NullList() {
        ArrayList<String> lst = null;
        ArrayList<String> result = ODD_COUNT.odd_count(lst);
        Assert.assertNull(result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the scenario where the input list `lst` is null. The expected behavior is that the method should return null.
