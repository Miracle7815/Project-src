Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases to cover the scenario where the `arr` contains only negative numbers. We will need to create instances of `ArrayList<Integer>` with negative numbers for testing.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Test_COUNT_NUMS {
    
    @Test
    public void testCountNums_OnlyNegativeNumbers() {
        ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>();
        arr.add(-123);
        arr.add(-456);
        arr.add(-789);
        
        int result = COUNT_NUMS.count_nums(arr);
        
        assertEquals(3, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are creating an `ArrayList` containing three negative numbers and then calling the `count_nums` method from the `COUNT_NUMS` class. The expected result is 3, as all numbers are negative and the sum of their digits is greater than 0.
