Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format to test the `total_match` method. 

Here is the code to instantiate the objects and the required import statements:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class TOTAL_MATCHTest {

    @Test
    public void testTotalMatch() {
        List<String> lst1 = new ArrayList<>();
        lst1.add("apple");
        lst1.add("banana");
        
        List<String> lst2 = new ArrayList<>();
        lst2.add("orange");
        lst2.add("grape");
        
        List<String> result = TOTAL_MATCH.total_match(lst1, lst2);
        
        assertEquals(lst1, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are creating two lists `lst1` and `lst2` with strings of varying lengths. We are then calling the `total_match` method with these lists and asserting that the result matches `lst1` since the total length of `lst1` is greater than the total length of `lst2`.
