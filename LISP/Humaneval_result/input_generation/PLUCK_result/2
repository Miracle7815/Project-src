Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertArrayEquals;

public class PLUCKTest {

    @Test
    public void testPluck_WithOddNumbers() {
        int[] arr = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};
        int[] result = PLUCK.pluck(arr);
        assertArrayEquals(new int[]{}, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `pluck` method with an input array containing only odd numbers as per the input specification. The expected result is an empty array since there are no even numbers in the input array.
