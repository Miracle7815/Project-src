Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertArrayEquals;

public class PLUCKTest {

    @Test
    public void testEmptyArray() {
        int[] arr = {};
        int[] result = PLUCK.pluck(arr);
        assertArrayEquals(new int[]{}, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `pluck` method with an empty array as input. The expected result is an empty array as well.
