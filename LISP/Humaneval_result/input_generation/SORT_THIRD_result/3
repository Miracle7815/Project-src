Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format to test the `sort_third` method. 

Here is the code to instantiate the objects and the required import statements:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class SORT_THIRD_Test {

    @Test
    public void testSortThird() {
        List<Integer> inputList = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(5, 2, 8, 1, 7, 3, 9));
        List<Integer> expectedOutput = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9));
        
        List<Integer> result = SORT_THIRD.sort_third(inputList);
        
        assertEquals(expectedOutput, result);
    }
}
``` 

In this test case, we are testing the `sort_third` method with an input list that contains elements where the size is not a multiple of 3. The expected output list is created based on the sorting logic described in the `sort_third` method.
