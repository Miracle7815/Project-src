Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format to test the `order_by_points` method. We need to create an empty array as input for the `nums` parameter.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertArrayEquals;

public class Test_ORDER_BY_POINTS {

    @Test
    public void testEmptyArray() {
        Integer[] nums = new Integer[]{};
        Integer[] expected = new Integer[]{};
        Integer[] result = ORDER_BY_POINTS.order_by_points(nums);
        assertArrayEquals(expected, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `order_by_points` method with an empty array as input. The expected result is also an empty array. The `assertArrayEquals` method is used to compare the expected result with the actual result returned by the method.
