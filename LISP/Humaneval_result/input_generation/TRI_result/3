Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format. We need to create instances of `n` which is greater than 0 and even.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertArrayEquals;

public class Test_TRI {
    
    @Test
    public void testTri() {
        int n = 4;
        int[] expected = {1, 3, 2, 6};
        int[] result = TRI.tri(n);
        assertArrayEquals(expected, result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testTri2() {
        int n = 6;
        int[] expected = {1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 10, 7};
        int[] result = TRI.tri(n);
        assertArrayEquals(expected, result);
    }
}
```

In the above code, we have created two test cases to test the `tri` method with different values of `n`. The `assertArrayEquals` method is used to compare the expected output with the actual output of the `tri` method.
