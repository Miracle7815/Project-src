Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write a JUnit test case to test the `check_dict_case` method with an empty HashMap as input. Here is the code snippet for the test case:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Test_CHECK_DICT_CASE {
    
    @Test
    public void testEmptyHashMap() {
        HashMap<Object, Object> dict = new HashMap<>();
        boolean result = CHECK_DICT_CASE.check_dict_case(dict);
        assertFalse(result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are creating an empty HashMap and passing it to the `check_dict_case` method. We then assert that the result should be `false` as per the input specification.
