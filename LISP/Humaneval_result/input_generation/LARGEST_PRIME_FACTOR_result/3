Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases to test the `largest_prime_factor` method. We need to provide a prime number `n` as input.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
import org.junit.Test;

public class TestLARGEST_PRIME_FACTOR {

    @Test
    public void testLargestPrimeFactor() {
        int n = 17; // Prime number
        int result = LARGEST_PRIME_FACTOR.largest_prime_factor(n);
        assertEquals(17, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `largest_prime_factor` method with a prime number `n = 17`. The expected result is `17`, as `17` is a prime number and its largest prime factor is itself.
