Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class ENCRYPTTest {

    @Test
    public void testEncrypt_emptyString() {
        String s = "";
        String result = ENCRYPT.encrypt(s);
        assertEquals("", result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `encrypt` method of the `ENCRYPT` class with an empty string as input. The expected output is also an empty string.
