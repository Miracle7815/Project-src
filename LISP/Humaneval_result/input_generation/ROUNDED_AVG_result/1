Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_ROUNDED_AVG {

    @Test
    public void testRoundedAvg_case1() {
        assertEquals("101", ROUNDED_AVG.rounded_avg(1, 5));
    }

    @Test
    public void testRoundedAvg_case2() {
        assertEquals("110", ROUNDED_AVG.rounded_avg(3, 8));
    }

    @Test
    public void testRoundedAvg_case3() {
        assertEquals("111", ROUNDED_AVG.rounded_avg(2, 6));
    }
}
```

In the above test cases, we are testing the `rounded_avg` method with different input values for `n` and `m` as per the input specification provided.
