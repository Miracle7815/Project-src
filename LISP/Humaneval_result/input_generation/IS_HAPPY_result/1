Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class Test_IS_HAPPY {
    
    @Test
    public void testIsHappy_NullString() {
        assertFalse(IS_HAPPY.is_happy(null));
    }
}
```

This test case checks the behavior of the `is_happy` method when the input string `s` is null. The expected behavior, based on the input specification, is that the method should return `false`.
