Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. Here is an example of how to write test cases for the `is_happy` method:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class Test_IS_HAPPY {

    @Test
    public void testIsHappy_NotHappy() {
        assertFalse(IS_HAPPY.is_happy("abca"));
    }

    @Test
    public void testIsHappy_NotHappy2() {
        assertFalse(IS_HAPPY.is_happy("xyyz"));
    }

    @Test
    public void testIsHappy_NotHappy3() {
        assertFalse(IS_HAPPY.is_happy("abcd"));
    }
}
```

In the above test cases, we are testing the `is_happy` method with strings that have a length greater than 3 characters but do not satisfy the conditions to be considered "happy". The `assertFalse` method is used to assert that the method should return `false` for these input strings.
