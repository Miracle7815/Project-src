Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format. 

Here is the code to instantiate the objects and the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_DO_ALGEBRA {

    @Test
    public void test_do_algebra_emptyOperand() {
        String[] operator = {"+", "-", "*", "/"};
        int[] operand = {};
        try {
            double result = DO_ALGEBRA.do_algebra(operator, operand);
            // As the operand is empty, the result should be the first operand which is 0
            assertEquals(0.0, result, 0.0001);
        } catch (NumberFormatException | ScriptException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `do_algebra` method with an empty operand array. The expected result is 0 because when the operand array is empty, the method should return the first operand which is 0.
