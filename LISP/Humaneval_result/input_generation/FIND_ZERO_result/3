Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. Here is the code to instantiate the objects and the required import statements:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class FIND_ZERO_Test {

    @Test
    public void testFindZero_1() {
        List<Double> xs = Arrays.asList(1.0, -3.0, 2.0); // Represents the polynomial x^2 - 3x + 2 which has zeros at x=1 and x=2
        double result = FIND_ZERO.find_zero(xs);
        assertEquals(1.0, result, 0.0001);
    }

    @Test
    public void testFindZero_2() {
        List<Double> xs = Arrays.asList(1.0, 0.0, -4.0); // Represents the polynomial x^2 - 4 which has zeros at x=-2 and x=2
        double result = FIND_ZERO.find_zero(xs);
        assertEquals(-2.0, result, 0.0001);
    }

    @Test
    public void testFindZero_3() {
        List<Double> xs = Arrays.asList(1.0, 0.0, 1.0); // Represents the polynomial x^2 + 1 which has no real zeros
        double result = FIND_ZERO.find_zero(xs);
        assertTrue(Double.isNaN(result));
    }
}
```

In the above code, we have created three test cases to test the `find_zero` method of the `FIND_ZERO` class. Each test case provides a different set of coefficients in the `xs` list to find the zero of the corresponding polynomial. The `assertEquals` and `assertTrue` methods are used to verify the expected results.
