Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases to cover the scenario where the input list `xs` is empty. 

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Test_FIND_ZERO {
    
    @Test
    public void testFindZeroWithEmptyList() {
        List<Double> xs = new ArrayList<>();
        double result = FIND_ZERO.find_zero(xs);
        assertEquals(Double.NaN, result, 0.0001);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we create an empty list `xs` and pass it to the `find_zero` method. The expected result is `Double.NaN` as the function should not be able to find a zero in an empty list.
