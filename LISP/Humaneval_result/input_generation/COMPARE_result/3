Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. We need to create instances of `game` and `guess` arrays with positive values and then compare the output of the `compare` method with the expected result.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertArrayEquals;

public class COMPARETest {

    @Test
    public void testCompare_1() {
        int[] game = {3, 5, 7, 9};
        int[] guess = {1, 4, 6, 8};
        int[] expected = {2, 1, 1, 1};
        int[] result = COMPARE.compare(game, guess);
        assertArrayEquals(expected, result);
    }

    @Test
    public void testCompare_2() {
        int[] game = {10, 20, 30};
        int[] guess = {5, 15, 25};
        int[] expected = {5, 5, 5};
        int[] result = COMPARE.compare(game, guess);
        assertArrayEquals(expected, result);
    }
}
```

In the above code, we have two test cases where we create instances of `game` and `guess` arrays with positive values and compare the output of the `compare` method with the expected result using JUnit's `assertArrayEquals` method.
