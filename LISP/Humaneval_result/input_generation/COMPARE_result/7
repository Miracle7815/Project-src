Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. We need to create instances of `game` and `guess` arrays with the same elements for testing the `compare` method.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertArrayEquals;

public class Test_COMPARE {
    
    @Test
    public void testCompare_1() {
        int[] game = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] guess = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] expected = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
        int[] result = COMPARE.compare(game, guess);
        assertArrayEquals(expected, result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testCompare_2() {
        int[] game = {5, 10, 15, 20};
        int[] guess = {2, 8, 12, 18};
        int[] expected = {3, 2, 3, 2};
        int[] result = COMPARE.compare(game, guess);
        assertArrayEquals(expected, result);
    }
}
```

In the above code:
- We import the necessary JUnit classes for testing.
- We create two test cases, each with different sets of `game` and `guess` arrays.
- We compare the expected result with the actual result obtained from the `compare` method using `assertArrayEquals` method.
