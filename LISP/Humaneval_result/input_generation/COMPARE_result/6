Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases using JUnit. We need to create instances of `game` and `guess` arrays with elements having zero values.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertArrayEquals;

public class COMPARETest {

    @Test
    public void testCompare_WithZeroValues() {
        int[] game = {0, 0, 0, 0};
        int[] guess = {0, 0, 0, 0};
        int[] expected = {0, 0, 0, 0};
        
        int[] result = COMPARE.compare(game, guess);
        
        assertArrayEquals(expected, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `compare` method with `game` and `guess` arrays having elements with zero values. The expected result is also an array with zero values.
