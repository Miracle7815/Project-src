Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class Test_MULTIPLY {
    
    @Test
    public void testMultiply_1() {
        int result = MULTIPLY.multiply(-5, 8);
        assertEquals(5, result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testMultiply_2() {
        int result = MULTIPLY.multiply(-12, 6);
        assertEquals(2, result);
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we have imported the necessary JUnit classes for testing. We have created two test cases to test the `multiply` method of the `MULTIPLY` class. The test cases cover scenarios where `a` is a negative number and `b` is a positive number, as specified in the input specification. The `assertEquals` method is used to verify the expected result against the actual result obtained from calling the `multiply` method.
