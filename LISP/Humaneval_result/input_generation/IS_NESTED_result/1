Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

public class Test_IS_NESTED {

    @Test
    public void testEmptyString() {
        assertTrue(IS_NESTED.is_nested(""));
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `is_nested` method with an empty string as input, which according to the input specification should return `true` if the count of opening brackets is greater than or equal to 2.
