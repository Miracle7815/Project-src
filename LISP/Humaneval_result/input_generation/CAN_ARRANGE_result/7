Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write the JUnit test case as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class TestCAN_ARRANGE {
    
    @Test
    public void test_can_arrange() {
        int[] arr1 = {1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6};
        assertEquals(4, CAN_ARRANGE.can_arrange(arr1));
        
        int[] arr2 = {10, 20, 30, 5, 40, 50};
        assertEquals(3, CAN_ARRANGE.can_arrange(arr2));
        
        int[] arr3 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9};
        assertEquals(7, CAN_ARRANGE.can_arrange(arr3));
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `can_arrange` method with different arrays where only one element is out of order. The expected output is the index of the element that is out of order.
