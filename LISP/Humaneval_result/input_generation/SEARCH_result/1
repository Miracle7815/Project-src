Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class SEARCHTest {

    @Test
    public void testSearch_NullList() {
        int[] lst = null;
        int result = SEARCH.search(lst);
        assertEquals(-1, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `search` method with a `null` list as input, as specified in the input specification. The expected result is `-1` as the method should return `-1` when the input list is `null`.
