Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases in JUnit format as follows:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class SEARCHTest {

    @Test
    public void testEmptyArray() {
        int[] lst = new int[]{};
        int result = SEARCH.search(lst);
        assertEquals(-1, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are testing the `SEARCH` class method `search` with an empty array as input. The expected result is -1 as specified in the input specification.
