Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases for the `skjkasdkd` method in the `SKJKASDKD` class. 

First, we need to import the necessary classes and packages for writing the test cases. 

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
```

Now, we can write the test cases for the `skjkasdkd` method with the input specification that `lst` is null:

```java
import humaneval.correct.SKJKASDKD;

public class TestSKJKASDKD {
    
    @Test
    public void testWithNullList() {
        int[] lst = null;
        int result = SKJKASDKD.skjkasdkd(lst);
        assertEquals(0, result);
    }
}
```

In this test case, we are passing a null list `lst` to the `skjkasdkd` method and expecting the result to be 0 as specified in the input specification.
