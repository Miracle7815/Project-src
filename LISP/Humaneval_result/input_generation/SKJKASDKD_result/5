Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases for the `skjkasdkd` method in the `SKJKASDKD` class. The input `lst` contains only prime numbers.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class TestSKJKASDKD {
    
    @Test
    public void testSKJKASDKD_1() {
        int[] lst = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
        int result = SKJKASDKD.skjkasdkd(lst);
        assertEquals(28, result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testSKJKASDKD_2() {
        int[] lst = {17, 19, 23, 29, 31};
        int result = SKJKASDKD.skjkasdkd(lst);
        assertEquals(22, result);
    }
}
```

In the above test cases, we are testing the `skjkasdkd` method with arrays containing prime numbers as input. The expected results are calculated based on the logic inside the method.
