Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases for the `skjkasdkd` method. We need to create instances of `lst` which contains only non-prime numbers.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class SKJKASDKDTest {

    @Test
    public void test_skjkasdkd_1() {
        int[] lst = {4, 6, 9, 15, 25};
        int result = SKJKASDKD.skjkasdkd(lst);
        assertEquals(1, result);
    }

    @Test
    public void test_skjkasdkd_2() {
        int[] lst = {8, 10, 12, 18, 21};
        int result = SKJKASDKD.skjkasdkd(lst);
        assertEquals(8, result);
    }
}
```

In the above test cases, we are testing the `skjkasdkd` method with arrays containing only non-prime numbers as per the input specification.
