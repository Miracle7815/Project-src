Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases for the `skjkasdkd` method. We need to test the method with different inputs, including a non-prime number as specified.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class TestSKJKASDKD {
    
    @Test
    public void testNonPrimeNumber() {
        int[] lst = {4, 7, 10, 13};
        int result = SKJKASDKD.skjkasdkd(lst);
        assertEquals(1, result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testAllPrimes() {
        int[] lst = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
        int result = SKJKASDKD.skjkasdkd(lst);
        assertEquals(1, result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testMixedNumbers() {
        int[] lst = {6, 8, 11, 15, 17};
        int result = SKJKASDKD.skjkasdkd(lst);
        assertEquals(8, result);
    }
}
```

In the above test cases, we are testing the `skjkasdkd` method with different arrays containing both prime and non-prime numbers. The expected results are based on the logic inside the method.
