Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases for the `skjkasdkd` method in the `SKJKASDKD` class. We need to create instances of the `lst` array containing a mix of prime and non-prime numbers.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class TestSKJKASDKD {
    
    @Test
    public void testSKJKASDKD_1() {
        int[] lst = {2, 4, 7, 10, 13};
        int result = SKJKASDKD.skjkasdkd(lst);
        assertEquals(5, result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testSKJKASDKD_2() {
        int[] lst = {3, 6, 8, 11, 15};
        int result = SKJKASDKD.skjkasdkd(lst);
        assertEquals(4, result);
    }
}
```

In the above test cases, we are testing the `skjkasdkd` method with arrays containing a mix of prime and non-prime numbers. The expected results are based on the logic implemented in the method.
