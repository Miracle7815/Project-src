Based on the provided API method and input specification, we can write test cases for the `skjkasdkd` method. We need to test the method with an array of integers and ensure that the method correctly finds the largest prime number in the array and calculates the sum of its digits.

Here is the JUnit test code with the required import statements:

```java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class TestSKJKASDKD {
    
    @Test
    public void testSKJKASDKD_1() {
        int[] lst = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
        int result = SKJKASDKD.skjkasdkd(lst);
        assertEquals(2 + 3 + 5 + 7, result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testSKJKASDKD_2() {
        int[] lst = {4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 17};
        int result = SKJKASDKD.skjkasdkd(lst);
        assertEquals(1 + 3 + 7, result);
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testSKJKASDKD_3() {
        int[] lst = {19, 23, 29, 31, 37};
        int result = SKJKASDKD.skjkasdkd(lst);
        assertEquals(1 + 9, result);
    }
}
```

In the above test cases, we are testing the `skjkasdkd` method with different arrays containing prime and non-prime numbers to ensure that the method correctly finds the largest prime number and calculates the sum of its digits.
