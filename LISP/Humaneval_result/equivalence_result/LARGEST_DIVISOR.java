The provided API method `largest_divisor` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the largest divisor of `n` (excluding `n` itself).

To partition the equivalence classes for testing this method, we can consider the following scenarios:

- class:
    1. `n`: is a prime number
- class:
    1. `n`: is a positive integer greater than 1 and not a prime number
- class:
    1. `n`: is 1
- class:
    1. `n`: is 0
- class:
    1. `n`: is a negative integer

These classes cover different scenarios such as prime numbers, non-prime positive numbers, edge cases like 0 and 1, and negative numbers to ensure the method behaves correctly across various input ranges.
