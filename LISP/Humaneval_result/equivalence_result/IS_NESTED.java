Based on the provided API method that checks if there are at least two nested brackets in a string, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input `brackets`:
- class:
    1. `brackets`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `brackets`: contains only opening brackets '[' with no closing brackets ']'
- class:
    1. `brackets`: contains only closing brackets ']' with no opening brackets '['
- class:
    1. `brackets`: has one pair of nested brackets
- class:
    1. `brackets`: has multiple pairs of nested brackets
- class:
    1. `brackets`: has non-nested brackets in specific order
- class:
    1. `brackets`: has non-nested brackets in random order

Testing with instances from each of these classes will help ensure the correctness of the `is_nested` method under various scenarios.
