Since the provided method is a simple static method that returns the length of a given string, there are not many complex conditions to consider. However, we can still partition the input space for testing purposes:

- class:
    1. `string`: is null
- class:
    1. `string`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `string`: is a non-empty string
