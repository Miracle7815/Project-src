Given the method `solve_string` in the provided Java class, the test inputs can be divided into the following equivalence classes for testing various scenarios:

- class:
    1. `s`: is null
- class:
    1. `s`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `s`: contains only non-alphabetic characters
- class:
    1. `s`: contains only lowercase alphabetic characters
- class:
    1. `s`: contains only uppercase alphabetic characters
- class:
    1. `s`: contains a mix of uppercase, lowercase, and non-alphabetic characters
- class:
    1. `s`: contains a mix of characters with no alphabetic characters
- class:
    1. `s`: contains a mix of characters with all lowercase alphabetic characters
- class:
    1. `s`: contains a mix of characters with all uppercase alphabetic characters
- class:
    1. `s`: contains a mix of characters with different lengths and combinations of alphabetic characters

These partitioned equivalence classes cover different scenarios to test the `solve_string` method effectively, ensuring good code coverage and identifying potential issues with the provided implementation.
