Based on the provided API method, which aims to find the next smallest integer in an array, we can identify the following equivalence classes for testing the `next_smallest` method:

- class:
    1. `lst`: is null
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only one element
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains multiple elements with duplicates
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains multiple elements without duplicates, and the second smallest element exists
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains multiple elements without duplicates, and the second smallest element does not exist (all elements are the same)
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains multiple elements without duplicates, and the second smallest element is the smallest element
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains multiple elements without duplicates, and the second smallest element is the largest element

By testing the `next_smallest` method with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure comprehensive coverage of the method's functionality.
