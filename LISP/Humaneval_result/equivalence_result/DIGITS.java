Based on the provided API method, which calculates the product of odd digits in a given integer `n`, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `n` as follows:

- class:
    1. `n`: is a positive integer with multiple odd digits
- class:
    1. `n`: is a positive integer with no odd digits
- class:
    1. `n`: is a positive integer with only one odd digit
- class:
    1. `n`: is a negative integer
- class:
    1. `n`: is zero
