Based on the provided API method, which generates a string sequence up to a given integer `n`, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `n` as follows:

- class:
    1. `n`: is a negative integer
- class:
    1. `n`: is zero
- class:
    1. `n`: is a positive integer

These classes cover the different scenarios that can occur when providing input to the `string_sequence` method. Testing with values from each class will help ensure the method behaves correctly under various conditions.
