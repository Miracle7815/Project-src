Based on the provided API method, the instances of `strings` should be generated to test the API method, which concatenates an array of strings into a single string.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the method body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `strings`:
- class:
    1. `strings`: is null
- class:
    1. `strings`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `strings`: contains one or more non-null strings
- class:
    1. `strings`: contains one or more null strings
- class:
    1. `strings`: contains a mix of null and non-null strings
