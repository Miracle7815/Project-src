Based on the provided API method, `circular_shift`, which takes two integer parameters `x` and `shift`, and performs circular shifting on the string representation of `x`, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameters as follows:

- class:
    1. `x`: negative integer; 2. `shift`: any integer
- class:
    1. `x`: 0; 2. `shift`: any integer
- class:
    1. `x`: positive integer; 2. `shift`: greater than the length of the string representation of `x`
- class:
    1. `x`: positive integer; 2. `shift`: less than or equal to the length of the string representation of `x`

These classes cover different scenarios such as handling negative integers, zero, shifting beyond the length of the string, and shifting within the length of the string. Testing with values from each class will help ensure the correctness and robustness of the `circular_shift` method.
