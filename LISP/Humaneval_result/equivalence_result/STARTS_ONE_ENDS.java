It seems that the provided code snippet is a Java class with a static method that calculates a value based on the input integer `n`. To partition the equivalence classes for testing this method, we can consider the following:

- class:
    1. `n`: is 1
- class:
    1. `n`: is less than 1
- class:
    1. `n`: is greater than 1

These classes cover the different scenarios that can affect the execution path of the `starts_one_ends` method. Testing with values from each class can help ensure that the method behaves correctly under various conditions.
