Based on the provided API method, which flips the case of characters in a given string, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `string` as follows:

- class:
    1. `string`: is null
- class:
    1. `string`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `string`: contains only lowercase characters
- class:
    1. `string`: contains only uppercase characters
- class:
    1. `string`: contains a mix of lowercase and uppercase characters

By testing with inputs from each of these classes, we can ensure that the method handles different scenarios effectively.
