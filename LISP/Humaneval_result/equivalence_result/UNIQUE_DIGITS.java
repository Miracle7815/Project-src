Based on the provided method, `unique_digits`, which takes an `ArrayList` of integers and returns a sorted list of integers containing only those numbers whose digits are all odd, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input `x` as follows:

- class:
    1. `x`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `x`: contains only one element which has all odd digits
- class:
    1. `x`: contains only one element which has at least one even digit
- class:
    1. `x`: contains multiple elements where all elements have all odd digits
- class:
    1. `x`: contains multiple elements where at least one element has at least one even digit

These equivalence classes cover various scenarios to ensure the method is tested thoroughly with different types of input data.
