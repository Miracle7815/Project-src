Based on the provided API method, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `arr` as follows:

- class:
    1. `arr`: is null
- class:
    1. `arr`: is an empty ArrayList
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains only positive numbers
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains only negative numbers
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains a mix of positive and negative numbers
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains zero
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains a mix of positive, negative, and zero

These equivalence classes cover various scenarios to test the `count_nums` method with different types of input ArrayLists.
