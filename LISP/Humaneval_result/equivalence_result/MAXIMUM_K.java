Based on the provided API method, `maximum_k`, which sorts an input ArrayList of integers and returns the maximum k elements from the sorted list, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameters `arr` and `k` as follows:

- class:
    1. `arr`: is null; 2. `k`: any integer value
- class:
    1. `arr`: is an empty ArrayList; 2. `k`: any integer value
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains one element; 2. `k`: any integer value
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains multiple elements; 2. `k`: less than or equal to 0
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains multiple elements; 2. `k`: greater than the size of the input ArrayList
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains multiple elements; 2. `k`: within the valid range (0 to size of the input ArrayList)
