Based on the provided API method, which calculates the sum of squares based on specific conditions for elements in an integer array, we can partition the following equivalence classes for the input array `lst`:

- class:
    1. `lst`: is null; empty array
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only elements where the index is a multiple of 3
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only elements where the index is a multiple of 4
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains a mix of elements where the index is or is not a multiple of 3 and 4
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains negative numbers
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains zero
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains positive numbers

By generating test cases from these equivalence classes, we can effectively cover different scenarios to validate the functionality of the `sum_squares` method.
