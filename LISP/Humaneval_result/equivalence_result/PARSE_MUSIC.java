Based on the provided API method, `parse_music`, which takes a `music_string` as input and returns a list of integers based on a mapping from notes to integers, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input `music_string`:

- class:
    1. `music_string`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `music_string`: contains notes that are mapped in the `note_map`
- class:
    1. `music_string`: contains notes that are not mapped in the `note_map`
- class:
    1. `music_string`: contains a mix of mapped and unmapped notes
- class:
    1. `music_string`: is null

These classes cover different scenarios to test the behavior of the `parse_music` method with various types of input strings.
