Based on the provided API method, we can identify the following input parameters and their potential equivalence classes:

- class:
    1. `x`: null; 2. `n`: null
- class:
    1. `x`: not null, `x` is not in the format "integer/integer"; 2. `n`: not null, `n` is not in the format "integer/integer"
- class:
    1. `x`: not null, `x` is in the format "integer/integer"; 2. `n`: not null, `n` is in the format "integer/integer", resulting in a valid calculation
- class:
    1. `x`: not null, `x` is in the format "integer/integer"; 2. `n`: not null, `n` is in the format "integer/integer", resulting in an invalid calculation

These equivalence classes cover scenarios where the input strings are null, not in the expected format, or in the correct format for valid or invalid calculations. Testing with inputs from each class can help ensure the method behaves as expected under various conditions.
