Based on the provided API method in the given Java code snippet, which sorts an array in a specific way depending on the sum of the first and last elements of the array, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input `array`.
Here are the equivalence classes for testing the `sort_array` method:
- class:
    1. `array`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `array`: contains only one element
- class:
    1. `array`: contains two or more elements
    	- sub-class:
        	1. The sum of the first and last element is odd
        	2. The sum of the first and last element is even

Additionally, for testing purposes, it would be beneficial to consider arrays with elements:
- having the same value
- having values in ascending order
- having values in descending order
- having random values

By covering the above equivalence classes and scenarios, you can ensure that the `sort_array` method is robust and covers various cases effectively.
