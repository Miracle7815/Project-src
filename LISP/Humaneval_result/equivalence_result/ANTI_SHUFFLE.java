Based on the provided API method, which aims to unshuffle a string by sorting the characters of each word in the string, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `s` as follows:

- class:
    1. `s`: is null
- class:
    1. `s`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `s`: contains a single word without spaces
- class:
    1. `s`: contains multiple words separated by spaces
- class:
    1. `s`: contains special characters or numbers in addition to letters
- class:
    1. `s`: contains words with varying lengths
- class:
    1. `s`: contains words with the same characters but in different orders
- class:
    1. `s`: contains words with the same characters in the same order

Testing with inputs from each of these equivalence classes will help ensure comprehensive coverage of the functionality provided by the `anti_shuffle` method.
