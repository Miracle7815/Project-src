Based on the provided API method, we can identify the following equivalence classes for testing the `even_odd_palindrome` method:

- class:
    1. `n`: negative integer
- class:
    1. `n`: 0
- class:
    1. `n`: positive integer
    2. `n`: 1
    3. `n`: 2
    4. `n`: 3
    5. `n`: even number greater than 3
    6. `n`: odd number greater than 3

These equivalence classes cover a range of scenarios to test the behavior of the `even_odd_palindrome` method with different input values.
