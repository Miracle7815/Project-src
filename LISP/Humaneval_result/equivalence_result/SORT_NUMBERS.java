Based on the provided Java method for sorting numbers represented as words, we can partition the equivalence classes for testing `sort_numbers` method as follows:
- class:
    1. `numbers`: is null
- class:
    1. `numbers`: is empty string
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains one word representing a number
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple words representing numbers in ascending order
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple words representing numbers in descending order
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple words representing numbers not in ascending or descending order
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple words representing numbers with some words not valid (e.g., "validWord invalidWord")
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple words representing numbers with all valid words but some duplicated
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple words representing numbers with all valid and unique words

Each of these classes represents a different scenario that can affect the behavior of the `sort_numbers` method and should be considered for testing to ensure the correctness of the sorting algorithm.
