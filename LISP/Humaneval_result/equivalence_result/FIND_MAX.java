Based on the provided API method, we need to partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `words` which is an array of strings. The method `find_max` sorts the input array based on the number of unique characters in each word and then returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters.

Here are the equivalence classes for the input parameter `words`:
- class:
    1. `words`: is null
- class:
    1. `words`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `words`: contains one word with unique characters
- class:
    1. `words`: contains multiple words with varying numbers of unique characters
- class:
    1. `words`: contains multiple words with the same number of unique characters

By testing with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the method handles different scenarios correctly and efficiently.
