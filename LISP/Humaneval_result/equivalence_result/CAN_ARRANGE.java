- class:
    1. `arr`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains only one element
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains elements in ascending order
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains elements in descending order
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains elements in random order with multiple elements out of order
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains elements in random order with only one element out of order
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains elements in random order with no elements out of order
