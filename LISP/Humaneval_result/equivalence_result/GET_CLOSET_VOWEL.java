Based on the provided method, we will generate test cases for the `word` parameter to achieve good code coverage:
  
- class: 
  1. `word`: has less than 3 characters â€“ edge case.

  1. `word`: contains a vowel at position `i`, with surrounding characters that are not vowels; 2. `word`: contains multiple vowels, each with at least one vowel and one non-vowel neighboring character.
- class:
  1. `word`: contains a vowel at position `i`, with a non-vowel character both before and after it; 2. `word`: contains a vowel at the start or end index; 3. `word`: contains multiple vowels but no qualifying vowels as per the condition in the method body.
