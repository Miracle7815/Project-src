Since our goal is to generate test cases that achieve good code coverage, we need to identify the equivalence classes for the input parameter `arr` of the `pluck` method. 

Here are the equivalence classes for the `arr` parameter:
- class:
    1. `arr` is an empty array.
- class:
    1. `arr` has only odd numbers.
- class:
    1. `arr` has only even numbers.
- class:
    1. `arr` has a mix of odd and even numbers.
- class:
    1. `arr` has duplicate even numbers.
- class:
    1. `arr` has duplicate odd numbers.

By designing test cases for each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the `pluck` method is tested thoroughly.
