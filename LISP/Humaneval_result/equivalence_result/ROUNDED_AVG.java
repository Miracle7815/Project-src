Based on the provided API method, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameters `n` and `m` as follows:

- class:
    1. `n`: less than `m`; 2. `m`: any integer greater than `n`
- class:
    1. `n`: equal to `m`; 2. `m`: any integer
- class:
    1. `n`: greater than `m`; 2. `m`: any integer

These classes cover the different scenarios that can occur based on the relationship between `n` and `m`.
