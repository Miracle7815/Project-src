Based on the provided API method, we can identify the following parameters that need to be tested: `s` and `c`. The method `reverse_delete` processes the input string `s` based on the characters in string `c` and returns an ArrayList containing the modified string and a boolean indicating if the modified string is a palindrome.

To achieve comprehensive test coverage, we can partition the input parameters into the following equivalence classes:

- class:
    1. `s`: is an empty string; 2. `c`: can be any string
- class:
    1. `s`: is a non-empty string; 2. `c`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `s`: contains characters that are all present in `c`; 2. `c`: can be any string
- class:
    1. `s`: contains characters that are not present in `c`; 2. `c`: can be any string
- class:
    1. `s`: is a palindrome; 2. `c`: can be any string
- class:
    1. `s`: is not a palindrome; 2. `c`: can be any string

By testing inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the `reverse_delete` method is thoroughly tested for different scenarios and edge cases.
