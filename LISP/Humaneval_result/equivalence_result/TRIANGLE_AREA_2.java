Based on the method signature and body provided, the instances of `a`, `b`, and `c` should be generated to test the `triangle_area_2` method, which calculates the area of a triangle based on its side lengths.
    To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the method body.
    Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `a`, `b`, and `c`:
    
    - class:
        1. `a`, `b`, or `c`: is less than or equal to 0
    - class:
        1. `a + b <= c` is true or `a + c <= b` is true or `b + c <= a` is true (invalid triangle sides)
    - class:
        1. `a`, `b`, and `c`: are valid triangle sides where `a + b > c`, `a + c > b`, and `b + c > a`
    - class:
        1. `a`, `b`, and `c`: are valid triangle sides where the triangle is an equilateral triangle (all sides are equal)
    - class:
        1. `a`, `b`, and `c`: are valid triangle sides where the triangle is a right-angled triangle
    - class:
        1. `a`, `b`, and `c`: are valid triangle sides where the triangle is a scalene triangle (no sides are equal)
