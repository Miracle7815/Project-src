It seems that there might be a mistake in providing the API method. The provided Java code does not represent a traditional API method but rather a collection of static methods within a class. 
In this case, we can consider two different methods within this class:
1. `is_prime(int n)`: A method to check if a given integer is a prime number.
2. `skjkasdkd(int[] lst)`: A method that takes an array of integers, finds the maximum prime number in the array, sums its digits, and returns the sum.

For the `is_prime(int n)` method, we can partition the following equivalence classes for the input `n`:
- class:
    1. `n`: a prime number
- class:
    1. `n`: a non-prime number

For the `skjkasdkd(int[] lst)` method, we can partition the following equivalence classes for the input `lst`:
- class:
    1. `lst`: is null
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only prime numbers
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only non-prime numbers
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains a mix of prime and non-prime numbers

For the `skjkasdkd(int[] lst)` method, we can also include cases where:
- The maximum prime number in the array is 0.
- The maximum prime number has one digit.
- The maximum prime number has multiple digits.
