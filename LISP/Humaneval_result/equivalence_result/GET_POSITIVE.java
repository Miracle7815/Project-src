Based on the provided API method, we need to partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `numbers` to test the `get_positive` method. This method filters out positive numbers from the input list and returns a list containing only positive numbers.

Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for the `numbers` parameter:
- class:
    1. `numbers`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains only positive numbers
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains only negative numbers
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains a mix of positive, negative, and zero numbers
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains only zero
- class:
    1. `numbers`: is null

By testing with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the `get_positive` method behaves correctly under various scenarios.
