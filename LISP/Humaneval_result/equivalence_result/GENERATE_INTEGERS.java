Based on the provided API method, `generate_integers`, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameters `a` and `b` as follows:

- class:
    1. `a`: less than 2; 2. `b`: less than 2
- class:
    1. `a`: less than 2; 2. `b`: between 2 and 8
- class:
    1. `a`: less than 2; 2. `b`: greater than 8
- class:
    1. `a`: between 2 and 8; 2. `b`: between 2 and 8
- class:
    1. `a`: between 2 and 8; 2. `b`: greater than 8
- class:
    1. `a`: greater than 8; 2. `b`: greater than 8
