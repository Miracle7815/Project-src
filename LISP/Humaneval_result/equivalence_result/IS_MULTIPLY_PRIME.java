Based on the provided API method, we can identify the following parameters and their potential equivalence classes for testing:

- class:
    1. `a`: is less than 2
- class:
    1. `a`: is a prime number
- class:
    1. `a`: is not a prime number
- class:
    1. `a`: is a product of three prime numbers
- class:
    1. `a`: is not a product of three prime numbers

These equivalence classes cover different scenarios to test the `is_multiply_prime` method effectively.
