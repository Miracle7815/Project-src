Based on the provided API method, which checks if a given number `x` is a simple power of another number `n`, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameters `x` and `n` as follows:

- class:
    1. `x`: is 1; 2. `n`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `x`: is greater than 1; 2. `n`: is 1
- class:
    1. `x`: is 0; 2. `n`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `x`: is a simple power of `n`; 2. `n`: is a prime number
- class:
    1. `x`: is not a simple power of `n`; 2. `n`: is a prime number
- class:
    1. `x`: is a simple power of `n`; 2. `n`: is not a prime number
- class:
    1. `x`: is not a simple power of `n`; 2. `n`: is not a prime number
