Based on the provided API method, we need to partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `numbers` to test the method `find_closest_elements`, which aims to find the two closest elements in the given array of numbers.

Here are the equivalence classes for the input parameter `numbers`:
- class:
    1. `numbers`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains only one element
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains two elements
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains more than two elements with distinct values
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains more than two elements with some duplicate values
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains more than two elements with all elements having the same value

By testing with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the method `find_closest_elements` behaves correctly under various scenarios.
