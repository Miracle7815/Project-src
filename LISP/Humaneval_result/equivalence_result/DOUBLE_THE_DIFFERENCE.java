Based on the provided API method, we need to partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `lst`, which is an array of double values. The method aims to calculate the sum of squares of odd positive integers in the array after converting them to integers.

Here are the equivalence classes for the input parameter `lst`:
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only non-integer double values
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only integer double values that are negative
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only integer double values that are positive but not odd
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only integer double values that are positive and odd
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains a mix of integer and non-integer double values
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains a mix of positive and negative integer double values
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains a mix of positive and negative integer double values, including odd and even numbers

Testing with inputs from each of these equivalence classes will help ensure comprehensive coverage of the method's functionality.
