Based on the provided API method, which generates all prefixes of a given string, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `string` as follows:

- class:
    1. `string`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `string`: is a single character string
- class:
    1. `string`: is a string with multiple characters

For each class, different test cases should be designed to cover various scenarios and ensure the correctness of the `all_prefixes` method.
