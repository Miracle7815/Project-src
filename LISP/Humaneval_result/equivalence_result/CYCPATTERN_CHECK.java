Based on the provided API method, we can identify the following parameters that need to be considered for partitioning the equivalence classes:

- class:
    1. `a`: is null; 2. `b`: can be any String
- class:
    1. `a`: is an empty string; 2. `b`: can be any non-empty String
- class:
    1. `a`: is a non-empty string; 2. `b`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `a`: is a string that contains the pattern specified by `b`; 2. `b`: can be any String
- class:
    1. `a`: is a string that does not contain the pattern specified by `b`; 2. `b`: can be any String

These equivalence classes cover various scenarios to test the `cycpattern_check` method with different combinations of input strings `a` and `b`.
