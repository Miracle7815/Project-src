This API method is a simple method to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to a given number `n`. Given the simplicity of the method, we can identify the following equivalence classes for testing:

- class:
    1. `n`: a positive integer
- class:
    1. `n`: a negative integer
- class:
    1. `n`: zero
- class:
    1. `n`: large positive integer to test for overflow scenarios
- class:
    1. `n`: large negative integer to test for overflow scenarios
- class:
    1. `n`: as `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to test boundary conditions
- class:
    1. `n`: as `Integer.MIN_VALUE` to test boundary conditions

Testing with these inputs will help ensure that the method covers a wide range of possible scenarios and edge cases.
