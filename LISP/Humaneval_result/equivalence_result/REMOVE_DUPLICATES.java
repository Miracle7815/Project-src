Based on the provided API method, we can identify the following equivalence classes for testing the `remove_duplicates` method:

- class:
    1. `numbers`: is null
- class:
    1. `numbers`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains only one unique element
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple elements with duplicates
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple elements without duplicates

These equivalence classes cover different scenarios to ensure comprehensive testing of the `remove_duplicates` method.
