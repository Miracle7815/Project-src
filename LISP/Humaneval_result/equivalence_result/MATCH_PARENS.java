Based on the provided code snippet including two methods `check` and `match_parens`, we can identify the following equivalence classes for testing each method:

For the `check` method:
- class:
    1. `s`: empty string

- class:
    1. `s`: string containing only "("

- class:
    1. `s`: string containing only ")"

- class:
    1. `s`: balanced string with equal number of "(" and ")"

- class:
    1. `s`: unbalanced string with more "(" than ")"

- class:
    1. `s`: unbalanced string with more ")" than "("

For the `match_parens` method:
- class:
    1. `lst`: empty array

- class:
    1. `lst`: array with one element

- class:
    1. `S1` and `S2`: balanced string

- class:
    1. `S1` and `S2`: unbalanced string

These equivalence classes cover the various scenarios and input conditions that can be used to test the `check` and `match_parens` methods effectively.
