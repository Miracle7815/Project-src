Based on the provided API method, we can identify the following parameters and their potential equivalence classes for testing:

- class:
    1. `str`: is null
- class:
    1. `str`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `str`: has a length that is not a multiple of 3
- class:
    1. `str`: has a length that is a multiple of 3

Since the method `decode_cyclic` is a bit complex with nested class and method calls, testing each equivalence class will help ensure that the method behaves correctly under different scenarios.
