The provided API method `make_a_pile` takes an integer `n` as input and generates an ArrayList of integers based on the formula `n + 2 * i`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.

To partition the equivalence classes for testing this method, we can consider the following classes for the input parameter `n`:
- class:
    1. `n`: negative integer
- class:
    1. `n`: zero
- class:
    1. `n`: positive integer

For each class, we can further divide the positive integer class into sub-classes based on the properties of the generated ArrayList:
- class:
    1. `n`: positive integer; 2. Generated ArrayList is empty
- class:
    1. `n`: positive integer; 2. Generated ArrayList has one element
- class:
    1. `n`: positive integer; 2. Generated ArrayList has multiple elements

By testing with inputs from these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the method handles different scenarios and produces the expected output.
