Based on the provided API method, `strange_sort_list`, which sorts a list of integers in a peculiar way, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input list `lst`:

- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only one element
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains multiple elements in ascending order
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains multiple elements in descending order
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains multiple elements in random order

These equivalence classes cover different scenarios to test the sorting behavior of the `strange_sort_list` method effectively.
