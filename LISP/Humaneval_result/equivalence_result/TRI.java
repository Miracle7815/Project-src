Based on the provided API method, which generates a sequence of integers based on a given input `n`, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input `n` as follows:

- class:
    1. `n`: is less than 0
- class:
    1. `n`: is equal to 0
- class:
    1. `n`: is greater than 0 and even
- class:
    1. `n`: is greater than 0 and odd

By testing with inputs from each of these classes, we can ensure that the method handles different scenarios correctly and produces the expected sequence of integers.
