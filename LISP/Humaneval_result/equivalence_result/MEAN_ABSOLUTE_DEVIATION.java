Since the method takes a List of Double numbers and calculates the mean absolute deviation, we can generate the following equivalence classes for testing:

- class:
    1. `numbers`: is null
- class:
    1. `numbers`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains one element (can be positive, negative, or zero)
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains more than one element with distinct values
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains more than one element with repeated values
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains both positive and negative values
- class:
    1. `numbers`: is very large in size (an upper boundary stress test)
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains extreme values (e.g., Double.MAX_VALUE, Double.MIN_VALUE)
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains NaN or Infinity values
