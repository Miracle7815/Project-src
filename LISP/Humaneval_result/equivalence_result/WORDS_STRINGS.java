Based on the provided API method, we can identify the following parameters and their potential equivalence classes for testing:

- class:
    1. `s`: is null
- class:
    1. `s`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `s`: contains only commas
- class:

- class:
    1. `s`: contains alphanumeric characters

By testing with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the method handles various scenarios effectively.
