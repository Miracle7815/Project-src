Based on the provided API method, we can identify the following input parameters and their potential equivalence classes:

- class:
    1. `a`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `a`: contains only positive integers
- class:
    1. `a`: contains only negative integers
- class:
    1. `a`: contains a mix of positive and negative integers
- class:
    1. `a`: contains duplicate integers
- class:
    1. `a`: contains unique integers
- class:
    1. `a`: contains integers that are not mapped in the `digit_map`
- class:
    1. `a`: contains integers that are mapped in the `digit_map`
- class:
    1. `a`: contains integers that are mapped in the `digit_map` and are sorted in ascending order
- class:
    1. `a`: contains integers that are mapped in the `digit_map` and are sorted in descending order

By testing the API method with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure comprehensive coverage and identify potential issues related to the sorting and mapping logic in the method.
