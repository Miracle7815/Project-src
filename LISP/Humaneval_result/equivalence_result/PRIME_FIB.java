Based on the provided API method, `prime_fib`, we can identify the following equivalence classes for testing:

- class:
    1. `n`: less than 2
- class:
    1. `n`: greater than or equal to 2
- class:
    1. `n`: a prime number
- class:
    1. `n`: a non-prime number

These equivalence classes cover the different scenarios that can occur when testing the `prime_fib` method with different input values for `n`. Testing with values from each class will help ensure comprehensive coverage of the method's functionality.
