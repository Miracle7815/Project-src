Since the provided method `decimal_to_binary` is a simple utility method that converts a decimal integer to a binary string, there are limited input parameters and logic involved. 
To partition the equivalence classes for testing this method, we can consider the following:

- class:
    1. `decimal`: a positive decimal integer
- class:
    1. `decimal`: zero
- class:
    1. `decimal`: a negative decimal integer

These classes cover the basic scenarios for testing the `decimal_to_binary` method.
