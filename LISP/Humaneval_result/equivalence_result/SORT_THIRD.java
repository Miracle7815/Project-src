Based on the provided API method, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `l`:

- class:
    1. `l`: is null
- class:
    1. `l`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `l`: contains elements where the size is not a multiple of 3
- class:
    1. `l`: contains elements where the size is a multiple of 3

These classes cover different scenarios that can affect the behavior of the `sort_third` method and help in designing test cases for comprehensive testing.
