Based on the provided API method, we need to partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `arr` to achieve comprehensive testing coverage. Here are the equivalence classes for the `arr` parameter:

- class:
    1. `arr`: an empty array

- class:
    1. `arr`: an array with only one element where:
        - The element is 0
        - The element is a positive number
        - The element is a negative number

- class:
    1. `arr`: an array with multiple elements where:
        - All elements are 0
        - All elements are positive numbers
        - All elements are negative numbers
        - Elements are a mix of positive, negative, and zero values

By testing with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the method is robust and handles various scenarios effectively.
