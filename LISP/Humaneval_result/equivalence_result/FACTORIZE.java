Based on the provided API method for factorizing an integer `n`, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `n` as follows:

- class:
    1. `n`: is a prime number
- class:
    1. `n`: is a composite number
- class:
    1. `n`: is a negative number
- class:
    1. `n`: is zero
- class:
    1. `n`: is one
- class:
    1. `n`: is a large number
- class:
    1. `n`: is the maximum integer value
- class:
    1. `n`: is the minimum integer value
