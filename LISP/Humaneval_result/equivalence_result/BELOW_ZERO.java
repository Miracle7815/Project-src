Based on the provided API method, we need to partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `operations`, which is a list of integers. The method checks if the cumulative sum of the integers in the list goes below zero at any point.

Here are the equivalence classes for testing the `below_zero` method:

- class:
    1. `operations`: an empty list
- class:
    1. `operations`: a list with only one element
- class:
    1. `operations`: a list with multiple positive integers that sum up to a positive value
- class:
    1. `operations`: a list with multiple positive integers that sum up to zero
- class:
    1. `operations`: a list with multiple positive integers that sum up to a negative value
- class:
    1. `operations`: a list with a mix of positive and negative integers that sum up to a positive value
- class:
    1. `operations`: a list with a mix of positive and negative integers that sum up to zero
- class:
    1. `operations`: a list with a mix of positive and negative integers that sum up to a negative value
- class:
    1. `operations`: a list with only negative integers

By testing these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the `below_zero` method behaves correctly under various scenarios.
