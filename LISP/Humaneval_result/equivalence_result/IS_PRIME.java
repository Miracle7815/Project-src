Based on the provided API method, which checks if a given number is prime, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `n` as follows:

- class:
    1. `n`: less than 2
- class:
    1. `n`: equal to 2
- class:
    1. `n`: a prime number greater than 2
- class:
    1. `n`: a non-prime number greater than 2

These classes cover the different scenarios that the method needs to handle to ensure comprehensive testing.
