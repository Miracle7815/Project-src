Based on the provided API method, `choose_num`, which takes two integer parameters `x` and `y` and returns an integer, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `x` and `y`:

- class:
    1. `x`: is greater than `y`; 2. `y`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `x`: is less than or equal to `y`; 2. `y`: is an even number
- class:
    1. `x`: is less than or equal to `y`; 2. `y`: is an odd number and `x` is not equal to `y`
- class:
    1. `x`: is less than or equal to `y`; 2. `y`: is an odd number and `x` is equal to `y`
