Based on the provided API method, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `txt` as follows:

- class:
    1. `txt`: is null
- class:
    1. `txt`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `txt`: contains a space character
- class:
    1. `txt`: contains a comma character
- class:
    1. `txt`: does not contain space or comma characters, and consists of lowercase letters with odd indices
- class:
    1. `txt`: does not contain space or comma characters, and consists of lowercase letters with even indices
- class:
    1. `txt`: does not contain space or comma characters, and consists of characters other than lowercase letters

These equivalence classes cover various scenarios to test the behavior of the `split_words` method with different types of input strings.
