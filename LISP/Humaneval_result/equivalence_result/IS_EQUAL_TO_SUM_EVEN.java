Given the simplicity of the provided `is_equal_to_sum_even` method with a single integer parameter, we can partition the equivalence classes for this API method as follows:

- class:
    1. `n`: is an even number that is greater than or equal to 8
- class:
    1. `n`: is an even number that is less than 8
- class:
    1. `n`: is an odd number
- class:
    1. `n`: is negative

Since the method only checks if the input integer is even and greater than or equal to 8, the equivalence classes are straightforward based on these conditions.
