The code snippet provided calculates the sum of squares of a list of double precision numbers. 
Based on the method signature and body, the instances of the `lst` input parameter should be generated to test the API method.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be considered to validate different scenarios in the method.

Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for the input parameter `lst`:
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `lst`: has only one element (e.g., [5.0])
- class:
    1. `lst`: has multiple elements with both positive and negative numbers

Additionally, the provided code uses `Math.ceil` to compute the square of each number. Therefore, we can further divide the classes to consider the effect of rounding up the numbers:
- For each class mentioned above, subdivide into cases where:
    - The elements result in a non-integer square after calling `Math.ceil`
    - The elements result in an integer square after calling `Math.ceil`
