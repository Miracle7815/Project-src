Based on the provided API method, which compares two strings based on their unique characters, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameters `s0` and `s1` as follows:

- class:
    1. `s0`: is null; 2. `s1`: can be any string
- class:
    1. `s0`: is an empty string; 2. `s1`: can be any string
- class:
    1. `s0`: is a string with unique characters; 2. `s1`: is a string with the same unique characters as `s0`
- class:
    1. `s0`: is a string with unique characters; 2. `s1`: is a string with different unique characters than `s0`
- class:
    1. `s0`: is a string with repeated characters; 2. `s1`: is a string with the same unique characters as `s0`
- class:
    1. `s0`: is a string with repeated characters; 2. `s1`: is a string with different unique characters than `s0`
