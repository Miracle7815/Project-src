Based on the provided API method, we need to partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `numbers` to test the method `triples_sum_to_zero`, which checks if there exist three numbers in the array that sum up to zero.

Here are the equivalence classes for the input parameter `numbers`:
- class:
    1. `numbers`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains only one element
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains two elements
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains three or more elements with at least one triplet that sums up to zero
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains three or more elements without any triplet that sums up to zero
