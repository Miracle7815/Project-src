Based on the provided API method, we need to classify the equivalence classes for the input parameter `grades` to effectively test the `numerical_letter_grade` method. Equivalence classes can be identified as follows:

- class:
    1. `grades`: is an empty array
    
- class:
    1. `grades`: contains one element which is within the range (0.0, 4.0]
    
- class:
    1. `grades`: contains one element that is equal to 4.0
    
- class:
    1. `grades`: contains one element each that falls into different grade range categories (e.g., 3.0, 2.5, 1.0)
    
- class:
    1. `grades`: contains multiple elements with different values that cover all grade range categories
    
- class:
    1. `grades`: contains elements that are outside the range (0.0, 4.0]

Testing with instances from each of these equivalence classes will help ensure that the method behaves correctly for different scenarios and input values.
