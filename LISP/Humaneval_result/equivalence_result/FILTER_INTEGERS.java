Based on the provided API method, the instances of `values` should be generated to test the API method, which filters out integers from a list of objects.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the method.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `values`:
- class:
    1. `values`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `values`: contains only integers
- class:
    1. `values`: contains only non-integer objects
- class:
    1. `values`: contains a mix of integers and non-integer objects
- class:
    1. `values`: is null
