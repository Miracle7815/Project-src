Based on the provided API method, which counts the number of uppercase vowels in a given string, we can partition the following equivalence classes for the input parameter `s`:

- class:
    1. `s`: is null
- class:
    1. `s`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `s`: contains only lowercase vowels
- class:
    1. `s`: contains only uppercase vowels
- class:
    1. `s`: contains a mix of uppercase vowels and other characters
- class:
    1. `s`: contains no vowels
- class:
    1. `s`: contains special characters or numbers

By testing with inputs from each of these classes, we can ensure that the method handles different scenarios correctly and efficiently.
