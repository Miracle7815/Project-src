Based on the provided API method, the `x_or_y` method takes three integer parameters `n`, `x`, and `y`, and returns an integer based on certain conditions. To effectively test this method, we need to partition the input space into equivalence classes for `n`, `x`, and `y`.

Here are the equivalence classes for the input parameters:

- class:
    1. `n`: 1; 2. `x`: any integer; 3. `y`: any integer
- class:
    1. `n`: a prime number greater than 1; 2. `x`: any integer; 3. `y`: any integer
- class:
    1. `n`: a composite number; 2. `x`: any integer; 3. `y`: any integer

These equivalence classes cover scenarios where `n` is 1, a prime number, or a composite number, and help ensure that the method is tested with different types of inputs to cover various execution paths.
