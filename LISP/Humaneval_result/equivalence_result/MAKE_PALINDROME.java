Based on the provided API methods `is_palindrome` and `make_palindrome`, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `str` in each method:

For `is_palindrome` method:
- class:
    1. `str`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `str`: is a palindrome string
- class:
    1. `str`: is a non-palindrome string

For `make_palindrome` method:
- class:
    1. `str`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `str`: is a palindrome string
- class:
    1. `str`: is a non-palindrome string

By covering these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the methods are tested with various scenarios to validate their functionality and handle different types of input strings effectively.
