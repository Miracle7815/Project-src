Based on the provided API method, we can identify the following parameters that need to be considered for partitioning the equivalence classes:

- class:
    1. `arr`: is null; 2. `k`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `arr`: is an empty ArrayList; 2. `k`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains elements with a length less than or equal to 2; 2. `k`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains elements with a length greater than 2; 2. `k`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains both elements with a length less than or equal to 2 and elements with a length greater than 2; 2. `k`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains elements with a length less than or equal to 2; 2. `k`: is negative
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains elements with a length less than or equal to 2; 2. `k`: is zero
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains elements with a length less than or equal to 2; 2. `k`: is positive

These equivalence classes cover various scenarios to ensure comprehensive testing of the `add_elements` method.
