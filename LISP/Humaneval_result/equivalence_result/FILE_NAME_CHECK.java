Based on the provided API method, which checks if a given file name meets certain criteria, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input `file_name` parameter as follows:

- class:
    1. `file_name`: is null
- class:
    1. `file_name`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `file_name`: does not contain a dot (.)
- class:
    1. `file_name`: contains more than one dot (.)
- class:
    1. `file_name`: has a valid format (contains one dot)
        - Subclass:
            1. `file_name`: valid format, extension is "txt"
            2. `file_name`: valid format, extension is "exe"
            3. `file_name`: valid format, extension is "dll"
            4. `file_name`: valid format, extension is not "txt", "exe", or "dll"
            5. `file_name`: valid format, extension is "txt", but other conditions are not met
            6. `file_name`: valid format, extension is "exe", but other conditions are not met
            7. `file_name`: valid format, extension is "dll", but other conditions are not met
            8. `file_name`: valid format, extension is not "txt", "exe", or "dll", but other conditions are met
            9. `file_name`: valid format, extension is not "txt", "exe", or "dll", and other conditions are not met

These equivalence classes cover various scenarios to ensure thorough testing of the `file_name_check` method.
