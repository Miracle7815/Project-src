Based on the provided API method `order_by_points`, we can identify the following equivalence classes for testing:

- class:
    1. `nums`: is null
- class:
    1. `nums`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains positive integers only
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains negative integers only
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains a mix of positive and negative integers
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains duplicate integers
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains integers with different numbers of digits
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains integers with the same number of digits
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains integers with the same absolute value but different signs

By testing with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure comprehensive coverage of the `order_by_points` method.
