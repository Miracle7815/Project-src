Based on the provided API method, `median(int[] list)`, which calculates the median of an array of integers, we can partition the following equivalence classes for the input parameter `list`:
- class:
    1. `list`: is null
- class:
    1. `list`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `list`: contains odd number of elements
- class:
    1. `list`: contains even number of elements

These equivalence classes cover the different scenarios that the method needs to handle, ensuring comprehensive testing coverage.
