Based on the provided API method, which aims to extract words from a sentence based on certain conditions, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `sentence` as follows:

- class:
    1. `sentence`: is null
- class:
    1. `sentence`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `sentence`: contains only one-word strings
- class:
    1. `sentence`: contains words with a length of 1
- class:
    1. `sentence`: contains words with a length of 2
- class:
    1. `sentence`: contains words with a length greater than 2 and not divisible by any number
- class:
    1. `sentence`: contains words with a length greater than 2 and divisible by at least one number

Testing with instances from each of these equivalence classes will help ensure comprehensive coverage of the method's functionality.
