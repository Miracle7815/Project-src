Based on the provided API method, which is responsible for encrypting a given string using a specific algorithm, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `s` as follows:

- class:
    1. `s`: is null
- class:
    1. `s`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `s`: contains only lowercase alphabetic characters
- class:
    1. `s`: contains only non-alphabetic characters
- class:
    1. `s`: contains a mix of alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters

By testing the method with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the encryption functionality is working correctly for various scenarios.
