Based on the provided API method, we can identify the following parameters that need to be tested:
1. List<Double> xs: The list of coefficients for the polynomial function.
2. double x: The value at which the polynomial function is evaluated.

To achieve comprehensive test coverage, we can partition the input parameters into the following equivalence classes:
- class:
    1. xs: Empty list
    2. x: Any valid double value
- class:
    1. xs: List with one or more coefficients
    2. x: Any valid double value

For the method `find_zero`, we can further partition the input parameters as follows:
- class:
    1. xs: List with coefficients that result in a zero value
- class:
    1. xs: List with coefficients that do not result in a zero value

These equivalence classes cover a range of scenarios to ensure thorough testing of the `poly` and `find_zero` methods.
