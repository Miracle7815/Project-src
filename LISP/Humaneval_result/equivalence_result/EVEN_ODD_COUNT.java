Based on the provided API method, the input parameter `num` is an integer used to count the number of even and odd digits in its absolute value. To partition the equivalence classes for testing this method, we can consider the following classes:

- class:
    1. `num`: is a positive integer with both even and odd digits
- class:
    1. `num`: is a positive integer with only even digits
- class:
    1. `num`: is a positive integer with only odd digits
- class:
    1. `num`: is a negative integer with both even and odd digits
- class:
    1. `num`: is zero

By testing the method with inputs from each of these classes, we can ensure that the method behaves correctly for various scenarios involving even and odd digit counts in the input number.
