Based on the provided API method `sort_array_binary`, we need to partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `arr`, which is an ArrayList of Integers. The method sorts the ArrayList based on the number of ones in the binary representation of the integers.

Here are the equivalence classes for testing `sort_array_binary` method:

- class:
    1. `arr`: is an empty ArrayList
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains a single element
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains multiple elements with varying numbers of ones in their binary representation
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains multiple elements with the same number of ones in their binary representation
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains negative integers
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains zero
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains positive integers
- class:
    1. `arr`: contains both positive and negative integers

By testing with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the `sort_array_binary` method handles different scenarios correctly and sorts the ArrayList based on the specified criteria.
