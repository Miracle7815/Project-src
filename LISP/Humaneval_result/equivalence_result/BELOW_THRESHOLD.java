Based on the provided API method, we need to partition the equivalence classes for the input parameters `l` (array of integers) and `t` (threshold integer) to test the `below_threshold` method effectively. 

Here are the equivalence classes for the input parameters:
- class:
    1. `l`: is an empty array; 2. `t`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `l`: contains only elements less than `t`; 2. `t`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `l`: contains at least one element greater than or equal to `t`; 2. `t`: can be any integer

By testing with inputs from each of these classes, we can ensure that the method is functioning correctly for different scenarios.
