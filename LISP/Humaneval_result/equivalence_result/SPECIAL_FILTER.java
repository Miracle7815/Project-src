Based on the provided API method, we need to consider the input parameter `nums` which is an array of integers. We should partition the equivalence classes for `nums` to ensure comprehensive testing coverage:

- class:
    1. `nums`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains only one element which is less than 10
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains only one element which is greater than or equal to 10
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains multiple elements where all elements are less than 10
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains multiple elements where at least one element is greater than or equal to 10
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains multiple elements where all elements are greater than or equal to 10
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains multiple elements where none of the elements satisfy the condition in the method

By testing with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the `special_filter` method is thoroughly tested for different scenarios.
