Based on the provided API method, which generates a list of prime numbers up to a given integer `n`, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `n` as follows:

- class:
    1. `n`: less than 2 (n < 2)
- class:
    1. `n`: equal to 2 (n = 2)
- class:
    1. `n`: a prime number greater than 2 (n > 2)
- class:
    1. `n`: a non-prime number greater than 2 (n > 2)

By testing with values from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the method behaves correctly for different scenarios and provides the expected list of prime numbers up to the given input `n`.
