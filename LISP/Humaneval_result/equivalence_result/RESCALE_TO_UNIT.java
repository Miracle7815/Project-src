Based on the provided API method, we need to partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `numbers` in the `rescale_to_unit` method. This method rescales an array of numbers to the unit interval [0, 1].

Here are the equivalence classes for the input parameter `numbers`:
- class:
    1. `numbers`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains a single element
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple elements with all elements being the same
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple elements with distinct values
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple elements with negative values
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple elements with positive values
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple elements with a mix of positive, negative, and zero values

By testing with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the `rescale_to_unit` method behaves correctly under various scenarios.
