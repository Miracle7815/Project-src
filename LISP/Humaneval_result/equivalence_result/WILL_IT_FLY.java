Based on the provided API method, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameters `q` (int array) and `w` (int) as follows:

- class:
    1. `q`: is an empty array; 2. `w`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `q`: contains only one element; 2. `w`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `q`: contains multiple elements with sum less than or equal to `w`; 2. `w`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `q`: contains multiple elements with sum greater than `w`; 2. `w`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `q`: contains multiple elements with sum equal to `w`; 2. `w`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `q`: contains multiple elements with symmetric values (palindromic array); 2. `w`: can be any integer
- class:
    1. `q`: contains multiple elements with non-symmetric values; 2. `w`: can be any integer

By testing the API method with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure comprehensive coverage of the method's functionality and edge cases.
