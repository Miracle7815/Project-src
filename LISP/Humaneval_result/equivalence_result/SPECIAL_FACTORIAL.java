The provided API method calculates a special factorial of a given number `n`. To partition the equivalence classes for testing this method, we need to consider the possible inputs and their impact on the calculation. 

- class:
    1. `n`: negative integer
- class:
    1. `n`: 0
- class:
    1. `n`: 1
- class:
    1. `n`: greater than 1

These classes cover the different scenarios that can affect the calculation of the special factorial. Testing with values from each class will help ensure the correctness and robustness of the `special_factorial` method.
