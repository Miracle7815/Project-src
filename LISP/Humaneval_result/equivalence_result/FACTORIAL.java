Based on the provided API method, which calculates factorial values based on the input integer `n`, we can partition the equivalence classes for testing as follows:

- class:
    1. `n`: negative integer values
- class:
    1. `n`: 0
- class:
    1. `n`: positive integer values
- class:
    1. `n`: large integer values that may cause overflow in calculations
- class:
    1. `n`: special cases like 1, 2, and 3 which have specific factorial values
- class:
    1. `n`: edge cases like the maximum and minimum integer values
- class:
    1. `n`: null or invalid input types (e.g., non-integer inputs)

By testing the API method with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure comprehensive coverage and identify potential issues related to input handling, calculation accuracy, and performance.
