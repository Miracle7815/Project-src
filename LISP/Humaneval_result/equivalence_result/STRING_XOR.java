Based on the provided API method, which performs an XOR operation on two strings character by character, we can partition the following equivalence classes for the input strings `a` and `b`:

- class:  
    1. `a`: is an empty string; 2. `b`: is an empty string
- class:  
    1. `a`: is a non-empty string; 2. `b`: is a non-empty string with the same length as `a`
- class:  
    1. `a`: is a non-empty string; 2. `b`: is a non-empty string with a different length than `a`
- class:  
    1. `a`: is `null`; 2. `b`: can be any non-null string
  
These equivalence classes ensure that different scenarios such as empty strings, strings of different lengths, and `null` inputs are covered during testing to verify the correctness of the `string_xor` method.
