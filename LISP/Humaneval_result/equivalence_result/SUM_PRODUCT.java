Based on the provided API method, the input parameter `numbers` is a list of integers. To effectively test the `sum_product` method, we need to partition the equivalence classes for the input `numbers` list.

Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for the `numbers` list:
- class:
    1. `numbers`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains only one element (e.g., [5])
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple positive integers
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains multiple negative integers
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains a mix of positive and negative integers
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains zero (0) as an element
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains a large number of elements
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains duplicate elements
- class:
    1. `numbers`: contains special values like null or non-integer elements

By testing with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the `sum_product` method behaves correctly and handles various scenarios effectively.
