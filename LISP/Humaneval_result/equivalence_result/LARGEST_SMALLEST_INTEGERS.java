Based on the provided API method, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `lst` as follows:

- class:
    1. `lst`: is null
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only negative integers
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only positive integers
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains a mix of positive, negative, and zero integers
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only zero integers

These equivalence classes cover different scenarios to test the functionality of the `largest_smallest_integers` method with various types of input arrays.
