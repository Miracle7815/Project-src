Based on the provided API method, we need to partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `lst`, which is an array of integers. The method aims to find the maximum value in the array that satisfies a specific condition.

Here are the equivalence classes for the input parameter `lst`:
- class:
    1. `lst`: is null
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only negative integers
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only positive integers
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains a mix of positive, negative, and zero integers
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains duplicate values
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains unique values
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains a single element
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains multiple elements

By testing with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the method behaves correctly under various scenarios and handles different types of input arrays effectively.
