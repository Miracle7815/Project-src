My apologies, but it seems there was a mistake in the API Method provided. The method `min_path` does not have any parameters, but it uses a 2D integer array `grid` obtained from the class scope and an integer `k` received as a parameter.  
Based on the method signature and body, the instances to be generated for testing should focus on `k` parameter as the operation performed inside the method is determined exclusively by the `grid` variable.
To achieve high code coverage, we can partition the `k` parameter into the following equivalence classes:
- class:
    1. `k`: 0 or negative values
- class:
    1. `k`: positive integer values

Since the functionality of the method depends solely on the `grid` array and the `k` value used to initialize the `ans` array, the partitioning is focused on the possible input values of `k`.
