Based on the provided API method, the method `compare` takes two integer arrays `game` and `guess`, and returns an integer array `result` containing the absolute differences between corresponding elements of `game` and `guess`.

To partition the equivalence classes for testing this method, we can consider the following classes for `game` and `guess`:

- class:
    1. `game`: is null; 2. `guess`: can be any integer array
- class:
    1. `game`: is an empty array; 2. `guess`: can be any integer array
- class:
    1. `game`: has elements with positive values; 2. `guess`: has elements with positive values
- class:
    1. `game`: has elements with negative values; 2. `guess`: has elements with negative values
- class:
    1. `game`: has elements with mixed positive and negative values; 2. `guess`: has elements with mixed positive and negative values
- class:
    1. `game`: has elements with zero values; 2. `guess`: has elements with zero values
- class:
    1. `game`: has the same elements as `guess`; 2. `guess`: has the same elements as `game`
- class:
    1. `game`: has different elements than `guess`; 2. `guess`: has different elements than `game`

By testing with instances from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure comprehensive coverage of the `compare` method.
