Based on the provided API method, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameters `planet1` and `planet2` as follows:

- class:
    1. `planet1`: is null; 2. `planet2`: can be any valid planet name
- class:
    1. `planet1`: is an empty string; 2. `planet2`: can be any valid planet name
- class:
    1. `planet1`: is a valid planet name; 2. `planet2`: is null
- class:
    1. `planet1`: is a valid planet name; 2. `planet2`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `planet1`: is a valid planet name; 2. `planet2`: is a valid planet name where `planet1` index is less than `planet2` index in the predefined list
- class:
    1. `planet1`: is a valid planet name; 2. `planet2`: is a valid planet name where `planet1` index is greater than `planet2` index in the predefined list
- class:
    1. `planet1`: is a valid planet name; 2. `planet2`: is a valid planet name where `planet1` index is equal to `planet2` index in the predefined list
