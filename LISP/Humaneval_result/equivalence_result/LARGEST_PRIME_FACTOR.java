Based on the provided API methods, we can identify the following equivalence classes for testing:

- class:
    1. `n`: less than 2
- class:
    1. `n`: greater than or equal to 2
- class:
    1. `n`: a prime number
- class:
    1. `n`: a composite number with multiple prime factors
- class:
    1. `n`: a composite number with only one prime factor

These equivalence classes cover different scenarios for testing the `largest_prime_factor` method with various types of input values.
