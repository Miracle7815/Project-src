Based on the provided API method, which calculates the MD5 hash of a given string, we can partition the following equivalence classes for the input parameter `text`:

- class:
    1. `text`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `text`: is a non-empty string
- class:
    1. `text`: is null

These classes cover the scenarios where the input string is empty, non-empty, or null, which are the critical cases to consider for testing the `string_to_md5` method.
