Based on the provided API method, we have two parameters `interval1` and `interval2` of type `int[]` that represent two intervals. The method `intersection` calculates the intersection of these intervals and checks if the length of the intersection is a prime number.

To effectively test this method, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameters as follows:

- class:
    1. `interval1`: is null; 2. `interval2`: can be any valid interval array
- class:
    1. `interval1`: is an empty array; 2. `interval2`: can be any valid interval array
- class:
    1. `interval1`: has valid values where `interval1[0] > interval1[1]`; 2. `interval2`: can be any valid interval array
- class:
    1. `interval1`: has valid values where `interval1[0] <= interval1[1]`; 2. `interval2`: has valid values where `interval2[0] > interval2[1]`
- class:
    1. `interval1`: has valid values where `interval1[0] <= interval1[1]`; 2. `interval2`: has valid values where `interval2[0] <= interval2[1]`
- class:
    1. `interval1`: has valid values where the intersection with `interval2` is empty; 2. `interval2`: has valid values where the intersection with `interval1` is empty
- class:
    1. `interval1`: has valid values where the intersection with `interval2` has a prime length; 2. `interval2`: has valid values where the intersection with `interval1` has a prime length
- class:
    1. `interval1`: has valid values where the intersection with `interval2` does not have a prime length; 2. `interval2`: has valid values where the intersection with `interval1` does not have a prime length
