Based on the provided API method, which aims to calculate the number of elements that need to be changed to make the array symmetric, we can partition the following equivalence classes for the input parameter `arr`:

- class:
    1. `arr`: is null
- class:
    1. `arr`: has an odd number of elements
- class:
    1. `arr`: has an even number of elements and is symmetric
- class:
    1. `arr`: has an even number of elements and is not symmetric
- class:
    1. `arr`: has only one element
- class:
    1. `arr`: has multiple elements but all are the same
- class:
    1. `arr`: has multiple elements with some differences that require changes to make it symmetric
