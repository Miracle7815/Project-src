Based on the provided API method, `sorted_list_sum`, which takes an `ArrayList<String>` as input and returns a sorted `ArrayList<String>` based on the length of the strings, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input `lst`:

- class:
    1. `lst`: is null
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains strings with odd lengths only
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains strings with even lengths only
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains strings with both odd and even lengths

These partitioned classes cover different scenarios to test the sorting functionality based on string lengths in the `sorted_list_sum` method.
