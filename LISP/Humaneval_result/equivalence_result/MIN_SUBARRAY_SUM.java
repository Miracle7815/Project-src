Based on the provided API method, we can identify the following parameters that need to be considered for partitioning the equivalence classes:

- class:
    1. `nums`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains only one element
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains multiple elements with both positive and negative values
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains multiple elements with only positive values
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains multiple elements with only negative values
- class:
    1. `nums`: contains multiple elements with all elements being zero

By considering these equivalence classes, we can design test cases that cover various scenarios and help ensure the correctness of the `min_subarray_sum` method.
