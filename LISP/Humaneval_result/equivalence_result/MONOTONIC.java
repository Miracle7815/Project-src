Based on the provided method and code, we can identify the following equivalence classes for testing the `monotonic` method:

- class:
    1. `l`: is null
- class:
    1. `l`: empty array
- class:
    1. `l`: array with non-monotonic sequence
- class:
    1. `l`: array with strictly increasing sequence
- class:
    1. `l`: array with strictly decreasing sequence
- class:
    1. `l`: array with strictly increasing sequence but not sorted
- class:
    1. `l`: array with strictly decreasing sequence but not sorted
- class:
    1. `l`: array with strictly increasing sequence and sorted
- class:
    1. `l`: array with strictly decreasing sequence and sorted
