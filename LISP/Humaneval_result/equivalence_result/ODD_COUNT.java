The provided code snippet seems to have some issues, such as missing imports, incorrect variable names, and incorrect string concatenation. However, based on the method signature and the intended functionality, we can still identify the equivalence classes for testing the `odd_count` method.

To partition the equivalence classes for testing the `odd_count` method, we can consider the following classes for the input `lst`:
- class:
    1. `lst`: is null
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains strings with no odd digits
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains strings with only odd digits
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains strings with both odd and even digits

It's important to note that the method implementation provided in the code snippet may not work correctly due to the issues mentioned earlier. Testing should involve fixing these issues before proceeding with the equivalence class testing.
