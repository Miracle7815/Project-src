The provided API method `fibfib` calculates the Fibonacci number for a given input `n`. To partition the equivalence classes for testing this method, we need to consider the possible inputs and their expected behavior. 

Here are the equivalence classes for the input `n`:
- class:
    1. `n`: negative values
- class:
    1. `n`: 0
- class:
    1. `n`: 1
- class:
    1. `n`: 2
- class:
    1. `n`: values greater than 2

For the Fibonacci sequence, the behavior can be categorized as follows:
- class:
    1. `n`: 0, expected output: 0
- class:
    1. `n`: 1, expected output: 0
- class:
    1. `n`: 2, expected output: 1
- class:
    1. `n`: values greater than 2, expected output: the sum of the previous three Fibonacci numbers

By testing the method with inputs from each equivalence class, we can ensure that the method behaves correctly for different scenarios.
