Based on the provided API method, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `date` as follows:

- class:
    1. `date`: is null
- class:
    1. `date`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `date`: is a valid date in the format "MM-DD-YYYY"
- class:
    1. `date`: is a date with an invalid month (less than 1 or greater than 12)
- class:
    1. `date`: is a date with an invalid day for months with 31 days
- class:
    1. `date`: is a date with an invalid day for months with 30 days
- class:
    1. `date`: is a date with an invalid day for February (greater than 29)
- class:
    1. `date`: is a date with an invalid day for February (29 or less, but not a leap year)
- class:
    1. `date`: is a date with an invalid format (e.g., not separated by "-")
- class:
    1. `date`: is a date with more than 3 parts when split by "-"
- class:
    1. `date`: is a date with non-numeric month, day, or year
- class:
    1. `date`: is a date with a valid format but causes an exception during parsing

Testing with instances from each of these equivalence classes can help ensure comprehensive coverage of the `valid_date` method.
