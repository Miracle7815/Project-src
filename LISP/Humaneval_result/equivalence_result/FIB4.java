Based on the provided API method, which calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a specific algorithm, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `n` as follows:

- class:
    1. `n`: less than 4
- class:
    1. `n`: equal to 4
- class:
    1. `n`: greater than 4

For each class, we can consider testing with representative values to cover different scenarios and potential edge cases.
