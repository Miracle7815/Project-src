Based on the provided API method, `is_sorted`, which checks if an array of integers is sorted, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `lst` as follows:

- class:
    1. `lst`: is null
- class:
    1. `lst`: is an empty array
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains only one element
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains two elements in ascending order
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains two elements in descending order
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains multiple elements in ascending order
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains multiple elements in descending order
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains multiple elements with duplicates and is sorted
- class:
    1. `lst`: contains multiple elements with duplicates and is not sorted
