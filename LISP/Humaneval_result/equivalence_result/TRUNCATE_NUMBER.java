The provided method `truncate_number` takes a double as input and returns the fractional part of the number by performing a modulo operation with 1.0. To partition the equivalence classes for testing this method, we can consider the following scenarios:

- class:
    1. `number`: positive double value
- class:
    1. `number`: negative double value
- class:
    1. `number`: zero
- class:
    1. `number`: a whole number (integer)
- class:
    1. `number`: a double with a fractional part
- class:
    1. `number`: a very large double value
- class:
    1. `number`: a very small double value
- class:
    1. `number`: NaN (Not a Number)
- class:
    1. `number`: positive infinity
- class:
    1. `number`: negative infinity

By testing the method with values from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the method behaves correctly and handles different types of input values appropriately.
