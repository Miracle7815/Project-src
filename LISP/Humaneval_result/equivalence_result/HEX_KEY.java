Based on the provided API method, which counts the occurrences of specific characters in a given string, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `num`:

- class:
    1. `num`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `num`: contains only characters other than '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'
- class:
    1. `num`: contains one or more occurrences of '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'
- class:
    1. `num`: contains a mix of characters, some of which are '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'
- class:
    1. `num`: contains only '2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D' characters
- class:
    1. `num`: is null

By testing inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the method behaves correctly for various scenarios.
