The provided API method `add` is a simple addition method that takes two integer parameters and returns the sum of those integers. Since the method is straightforward and does not have complex logic, the partitioning of equivalence classes for testing can be simplified.

- class:
    1. `x` and `y`: both positive integers
- class:
    1. `x` and `y`: both negative integers
- class:
    1. `x` is positive and `y` is negative
- class:
    1. `x` is negative and `y` is positive
- class:
    1. `x` is zero and `y` is a non-zero integer
- class:
    1. `x` is a non-zero integer and `y` is zero
- class:
    1. `x` and `y`: both zero
