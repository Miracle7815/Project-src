The provided API method `car_race_collision` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the square of `n`. To partition the equivalence classes for testing this method, we can consider the following classes:

- class:
    1. `n`: negative integer
- class:
    1. `n`: zero
- class:
    1. `n`: positive integer

These classes cover the different categories of input values that can be provided to the `car_race_collision` method for testing.
