Based on the provided API method, we need to partition the equivalence classes for the input parameter `l`, which is a list of integers. The goal is to determine if there exist two numbers in the list that sum up to zero.

Here are the equivalence classes for the input parameter `l`:
- class:
    1. `l`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `l`: contains only one element which is 0
- class:
    1. `l`: contains only one element which is not 0
- class:
    1. `l`: contains two elements that sum up to zero
- class:
    1. `l`: contains two elements that do not sum up to zero
- class:
    1. `l`: contains more than two elements where there exist two elements that sum up to zero
- class:
    1. `l`: contains more than two elements where there does not exist two elements that sum up to zero
