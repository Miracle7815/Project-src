Based on the provided API method, we need to consider the input parameters `strings` and `prefix` for partitioning the equivalence classes. 

Here are the equivalence classes for testing the `filter_by_prefix` method:

- class:
    1. `strings`: is null; 2. `prefix`: can be any string
- class:
    1. `strings`: is an empty list; 2. `prefix`: can be any string
- class:
    1. `strings`: contains strings that start with the `prefix`; 2. `prefix`: is a valid prefix that matches some strings in the list
- class:
    1. `strings`: contains strings that do not start with the `prefix`; 2. `prefix`: is a valid prefix that does not match any strings in the list
- class:
    1. `strings`: contains strings that start with the `prefix`; 2. `prefix`: is an empty string
- class:
    1. `strings`: contains strings that do not start with the `prefix`; 2. `prefix`: is an empty string
