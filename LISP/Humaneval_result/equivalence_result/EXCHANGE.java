Based on the provided API method, we need to partition the equivalence classes for the input parameters `lst1` and `lst2` to test the `exchange` method effectively. 

Here are the equivalence classes for the input parameters:
- class:
    1. `lst1`: is an empty list; 2. `lst2`: can be any list
- class:
    1. `lst1`: contains only even numbers; 2. `lst2`: can be any list
- class:
    1. `lst1`: contains only odd numbers; 2. `lst2`: can be any list
- class:
    1. `lst1`: contains a mix of odd and even numbers; 2. `lst2`: can be any list
- class:
    1. `lst1`: is null; 2. `lst2`: can be any list

By testing the `exchange` method with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure good coverage of the method's logic and behavior.
