Based on the provided API method, `max_fill`, which calculates the maximum number of buckets needed to fill a grid based on the bucket capacity, we can partition the equivalence classes for the input parameters as follows:

- class:
    1. `grid`: is null; 2. `bucket_capacity`: can be any integer value
- class:
    1. `grid`: is an empty 2D array; 2. `bucket_capacity`: can be any integer value
- class:
    1. `grid`: contains one or more rows with one or more elements; 2. `bucket_capacity`: is a positive integer
- class:
    1. `grid`: contains one or more rows with one or more elements; 2. `bucket_capacity`: is zero
- class:
    1. `grid`: contains one or more rows with one or more elements; 2. `bucket_capacity`: is a negative integer
- class:
    1. `grid`: contains one or more rows with one or more elements; 2. `bucket_capacity`: is a positive integer that evenly divides the sum of elements in each row
- class:
    1. `grid`: contains one or more rows with one or more elements; 2. `bucket_capacity`: is a positive integer that does not evenly divide the sum of elements in each row
