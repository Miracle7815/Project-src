Based on the provided API method, `incr_list`, which takes a list of integers and increments each element by 1, we can partition the following equivalence classes for the input list `l`:

- class:
    1. `l`: is an empty list
- class:
    1. `l`: contains one or more positive integers
- class:
    1. `l`: contains one or more negative integers
- class:
    1. `l`: contains one or more zero values
- class:
    1. `l`: contains a mix of positive, negative, and zero values
- class:
    1. `l`: contains duplicate values
- class:
    1. `l`: contains a single element
- class:
    1. `l`: contains a large number of elements
- class:
    1. `l`: is null

By testing with inputs from each of these equivalence classes, we can ensure that the `incr_list` method behaves correctly and handles various scenarios effectively.
