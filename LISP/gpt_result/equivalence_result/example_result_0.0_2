Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `accurate` and `approximate` should be generated to test the API method, which compares two double values while ignoring missing fraction digits.

To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body. Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `accurate` and `approximate`:
- class:
    1. `accurate`: is NaN; 2. `approximate`: can be any double value
- class:
    1. `accurate`: is positive infinity; 2. `approximate`: can be any double value
- class:
    1. `accurate`: is negative infinity; 2. `approximate`: can be any double value
- class:
    1. `accurate`: is a finite value; 2. `approximate`: is NaN
- class:
    1. `accurate`: is a finite value; 2. `approximate`: is positive infinity
- class:
    1. `accurate`: is a finite value; 2. `approximate`: is negative infinity
- class:
    1. `accurate`: is a finite value; 2. `approximate`: is a finite value, and the difference between them is less than 1
- class:
    1. `accurate`: is a finite value; 2. `approximate`: is a finite value, and the difference between them is greater than or equal to 1

These equivalence classes cover various scenarios to ensure thorough testing of the `equalsIgnoreMissingFractionDigits` method.
