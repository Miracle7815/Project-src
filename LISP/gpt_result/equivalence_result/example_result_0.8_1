Based on the method signature and body, the instances of `accurate` and `approximate` should be generated to test the API method, which checks if two double values are equal when ignoring minor differences in the fractional part.
To achieve high code coverage, diverse instances should be generated to reach different branches in the Method Body.
Therefore, we can partition the following equivalence classes for `accurate` and `approximate`:
- class:
    1. `accurate`: 0; 2. `approximate`: can be any double value
- class:
    1. `accurate`: can be a positive or negative double value that is close to 0; 2. `approximate`: can be any double value
- class:
    1. `accurate`: can be a positive or negative double value that is not close to 0; 2. `approximate`: can be any double value
- class:
    1. `accurate`: is equal to `approximate`
- class:
    1. `accurate`: is not equal to `approximate`
