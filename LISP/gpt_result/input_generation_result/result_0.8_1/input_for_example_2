According to the signature of the code, we can see that the method `equalsIgnoreMissingFractionDigits` takes two double values `accurate` and `approximate` as input parameters.
The input specification states that `accurate` can be a positive or negative double value close to 0, and `approximate` can be any double value.

Based on the method signature and input specification, we can provide test inputs as follows:

Example 1:
Part 1. The objects initialized:
```java
double accurate = 0.0001;
double approximate = 0.0002;
```

Example 2:
Part 1. The objects initialized:
```java
double accurate = -0.00001;
double approximate = 0.00002;
```

According to the code above, the following import statements must be required:
```java
import java.lang.Math;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;
```
