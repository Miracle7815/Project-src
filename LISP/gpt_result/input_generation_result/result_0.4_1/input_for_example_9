I'm sorry, but the provided API method seems to be quite complex and specific, making it challenging to generate meaningful test inputs without a clear understanding of the underlying logic and requirements. To create appropriate test inputs for this method, a deeper understanding of the method's functionality, expected behavior, and the context in which it is used would be necessary.

If you can provide more information about the purpose of the method, the expected outcomes for different scenarios, and any constraints or edge cases that need to be considered, I would be happy to assist you in generating relevant test inputs.
