According to the signature of the code,
we can see that the method `equalsIgnoreMissingFractionDigits` takes two double values `accurate` and `approximate` as input parameters.
The input specification states that `accurate` should be a positive value and `approximate` should be a negative value.

Based on the method signature and input specification, we can provide test inputs as follows:

Example 1:
Part 1. The objects initialized:
```java
double accurate = 10.5;
double approximate = -5.5;
```

Part 2. Required import statements:
```java
import java.lang.Math;
```

Example 2:
Part 1. The objects initialized:
```java
double accurate = 7.8;
double approximate = -3.2;
```

Part 2. Required import statements:
```java
import java.lang.Math;
```
