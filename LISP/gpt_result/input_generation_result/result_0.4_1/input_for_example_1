I'm sorry, but the provided API method seems to be quite complex and involves a lot of internal calculations and logic that are not directly related to the input specification provided. It would be challenging to provide specific test inputs without a deeper understanding of the internal workings of the method and the expected behavior.

If you have any specific requirements or constraints for the test inputs, please let me know so that I can assist you further in generating appropriate test inputs for the given API method.
