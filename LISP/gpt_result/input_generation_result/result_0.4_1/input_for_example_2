Anwser: Let's do this step by step. 
According to the signature of the code, we can see that the method `equalsIgnoreMissingFractionDigits` takes two double values `accurate` and `approximate`.
In the input specification, both `accurate` and `approximate` are positive non-zero values.
Based on the method signature and body, we can write instances of `accurate` and `approximate` and required import statements based on the input specification:

Example 1: 
    Part 1. The objects initialized:
        ```java
        double accurate = 10.5;
        double approximate = 10.6;
        ```

    Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
        ```java
        import java.lang.Double;
        import java.lang.Math;
        ```

Example 2:
    Part 1. The objects initialized:
        ```java
        double accurate = 3.14159;
        double approximate = 3.1416;
        ```

    Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
        ```java
        import java.lang.Double;
        import java.lang.Math;
        ```
