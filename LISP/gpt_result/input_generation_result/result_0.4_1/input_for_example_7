In the input specification, `accurate` is specified as 0 and `approximate` is specified as a positive non-zero value.

Example 1: 
```java
double accurate = 0.0;
double approximate = 1.234;
```

Example 2:
```java
double accurate = 0.0;
double approximate = 0.001;
```

Part 2: 
According to the code provided, the required import statements are as follows:
```java
import java.lang.Math;
import java.util.Arrays;
