According to the signature of the code, we can see that the method `equalsIgnoreMissingFractionDigits` takes two `double` values as input parameters. In the input specification, `accurate` is specified to be a finite value, while `approximate` is specified to be positive infinity.

Based on the method signature and input specification, we can provide the following test inputs:

Example 1:
Part 1. The objects initialized:
```java
double accurate = 10.5;
double approximate = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
```

Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
```java
import java.lang.Double;
```

Example 2:
Part 1. The objects initialized:
```java
double accurate = 3.14;
double approximate = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
```

Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
```java
import java.lang.Double;
```
