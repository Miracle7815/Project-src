Anwser: Let's do this step by step. 
According to the signature of the code, we can see that the method `equalsIgnoreMissingFractionDigits` takes two double values `accurate` and `approximate` as input.
In the input specification, `accurate` is specified to be NaN (Not-a-Number), and `approximate` can be any double value.
Based on the method signature and body, we can provide test inputs for `accurate` and `approximate` and the required import statements:

Example 1: 
    Part 1. The objects initialized:
        ```java
        double accurate = Double.NaN;
        double approximate = 10.5;
        ```

    Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
        ```java
        import java.lang.Double;
        ```

Example 2:
    Part 1. The objects initialized:
        ```java
        double accurate = Double.NaN;
        double approximate = -3.14;
        ```

    Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
        ```java
        import java.lang.Double;
        ```
