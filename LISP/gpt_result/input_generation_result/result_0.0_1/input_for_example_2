Anwser: Let's do this step by step. 
According to the signature of the code, we can see that the method `equalsIgnoreMissingFractionDigits` takes two double values `accurate` and `approximate`.
In the input specification, `accurate` is specified to be positive infinity, and `approximate` can be any double value.
Based on the method signature and body, we do not need to instantiate any objects for this method. We can directly test the method with the specified input values.

Example 1: 
    Part 1. No objects need to be instantiated for this method.

    Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
        ```java
        import java.lang.Math;
        ```

Example 2:
    Part 1. No objects need to be instantiated for this method.

    Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
        ```java
        import java.lang.Math;
        ```
