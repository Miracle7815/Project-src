According to the signature of the code, we can see that the method `equalsIgnoreMissingFractionDigits` takes two double values `accurate` and `approximate` as input parameters. 

In the input specification, `accurate` is specified to be a finite value, while `approximate` is specified to be NaN (Not-a-Number).

Based on the method signature and the input specification, we can provide test inputs as follows:

Example 1:
Part 1. The objects initialized:
```java
double accurate = 10.0;
double approximate = Double.NaN;
```

Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
```java
import java.lang.Double;
```

Example 2:
Part 1. The objects initialized:
```java
double accurate = 3.14;
double approximate = Double.NaN;
```

Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
```java
import java.lang.Double;
```
