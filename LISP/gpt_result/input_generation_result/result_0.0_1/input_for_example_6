According to the signature of the code, we can see that the method `equalsIgnoreMissingFractionDigits` takes two `double` values as input parameters.
The input specification states that `accurate` is a finite value and `approximate` is negative infinity.

Based on the input specification, we can provide the following test inputs:

Example 1:
- Part 1. The objects initialized:
```java
double accurate = 10.0;
double approximate = Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
```

- Part 2. Required import statements:
```java
import java.lang.Double;
```

Example 2:
- Part 1. The objects initialized:
```java
double accurate = 3.14;
double approximate = Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
```

- Part 2. Required import statements:
```java
import java.lang.Double;
```
