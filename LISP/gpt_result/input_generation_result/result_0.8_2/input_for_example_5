I'm sorry, but the provided API method seems to be quite complex and involves a lot of mathematical calculations and conditions. Writing specific test inputs for this method without a clear understanding of the underlying logic and requirements may not be feasible. 

To effectively test this method, it would be necessary to have a deeper understanding of the expected behavior, edge cases, and constraints. Additionally, the method seems to rely on external utility methods like `Numerics.toExp10` and `MathFunctions.getExponent`, which are not provided in the code snippet.

If you can provide more context or details about the expected behavior and constraints of the `equalsIgnoreMissingFractionDigits` method, I would be happy to assist you in writing test inputs for it.
