I'm sorry, but the provided API method seems to be quite complex and involves a lot of mathematical calculations and conditions that are not directly related to typical input values. It would be challenging to provide specific test inputs without a deeper understanding of the mathematical logic and constraints involved in the method.

If you have specific test scenarios or constraints in mind that you would like to test for this method, please provide them so that I can assist you in generating appropriate test inputs.
