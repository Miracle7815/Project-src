Part 1: 
According to the signature of the code, we can see that we need to provide instances of `accurate` and `approximate`.
In the input specification, it is mentioned that `accurate` should be equal to `approximate`.
Based on the method signature and body, we can provide instances of `accurate` and `approximate`:

Example 1: 
```java
double accurate = 10.0;
double approximate = 10.0;
```

Example 2:
```java
double accurate = 3.14159;
double approximate = 3.14159;
```

Part 2: 
According to the code above, the following import statements must be required:
```java
import java.lang.Math;
```
