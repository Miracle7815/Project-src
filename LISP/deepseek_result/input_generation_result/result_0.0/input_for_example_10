Anwser: Let's do this step by step. 
According to the signature of the code, we can know that we should write instances of `accurate` and `approximate`.
In the input specification, `accurate` is any double value, and `approximate` is NaN.
Based on the method signature, body, we can write instances of `accurate` and `approximate` and required import statements based on and the input specification:

Example 1: 
    Part 1. The objects initialized:
        ```java
        double accurate = 3.14159;
        double approximate = Double.NaN;
        ```

    Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
        ```java
        import java.lang.Double;
        ```

Example 2:
    Part 1. The objects initialized:
        ```java
        double accurate = 2.71828;
        double approximate = Double.NaN;
        ```

    Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
        ```java
        import java.lang.Double;
        ```
