Anwser: Let's do this step by step. 
According to the signature of the code, we can know that we should write instances of `accurate` and `approximate`.
In the input specification, `accurate` is NaN, and `approximate` can be any double value.
Based on the method signature, body, we can write instances of `accurate` and `approximate` and required import statements based on and the input specification:

Example 1: 
    Part 1. The objects initialized:
        ```java
        double accurate = Double.NaN;
        double approximate = 3.14;
        ```

    Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
        ```java
        import java.lang.Double;
        ```

Example 2:
    Part 1. The objects initialized:
        ```java
        double accurate = Double.NaN;
        double approximate = 0.0;
        ```

    Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
        ```java
        import java.lang.Double;
        ```
     

The method `equalsIgnoreMissingFractionDigits` is designed to compare two double values, `accurate` and `approximate`, while ignoring minor differences in fraction digits. However, when `accurate` is NaN, the method will return `false` because NaN is not equal to any value, including itself. This behavior is consistent with the IEEE 754 floating-point standard.
