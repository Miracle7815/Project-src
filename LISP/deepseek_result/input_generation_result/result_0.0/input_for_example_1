Anwser: Let's do this step by step. 
According to the signature of the code, we can know that we should write instances of `accurate` and `approximate`.
In the input specification, `accurate` is any double value, and `approximate` is any double value where the absolute difference (`delta`) is greater than or equal to 1.
Based on the method signature, body, we can write instances of `accurate` and `approximate` and required import statements based on and the input specification:

Example 1: 
    Part 1. The objects initialized:
        ```java
        double accurate = 10.5;
        double approximate = 12.0;
        ```

    Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
        ```java
        import java.lang.Double;
        ```

Example 2:
    Part 1. The objects initialized:
        ```java
        double accurate = 100.75;
        double approximate = 102.0;
        ```

    Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
        ```java
        import java.lang.Double;
        ```
     

These examples satisfy the input specification where `delta` (the absolute difference between `accurate` and `approximate`) is greater than or equal to 1.
