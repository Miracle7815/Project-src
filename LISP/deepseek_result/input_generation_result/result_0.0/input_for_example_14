Anwser: Let's do this step by step. 
According to the signature of the code, we can know that we should write instances of `accurate` and `approximate`.
In the input specification, `accurate` is negative infinity and `approximate` is positive infinity. These are special double values in Java.
Based on the method signature, body, we can write instances of `accurate` and `approximate` and required import statements based on and the input specification:

Example 1: 
    Part 1. The objects initialized:
        ```java
        double accurate = Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
        double approximate = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
        ```

    Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
        ```java
        import java.lang.Double;
        ```

Example 2:
    Part 1. The objects initialized:
        ```java
        double accurate = Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
        double approximate = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
        ```

    Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
        ```java
        import java.lang.Double;
        ```
