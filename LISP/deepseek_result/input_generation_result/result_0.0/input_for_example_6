Anwser: Let's do this step by step. 
According to the signature of the code, we can know that we should write instances of `accurate` and `approximate`.
In the input specification, `accurate` is any double value, and `approximate` is any double value where `delta` is less than 1, and `p` is valid, but `Math.abs(approximate - diffInFractions) > Math.ulp(diffInFractions)`.
Based on the method signature, body, we can write instances of `accurate` and `approximate` and required import statements based on and the input specification:

Example 1: 
    Part 1. The objects initialized:
        ```java
        double accurate = 1.23456789;
        double approximate = 1.23456788;
        ```

    Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
        ```java
        import java.lang.Double;
        ```

Example 2:
    Part 1. The objects initialized:
        ```java
        double accurate = 2.34567891;
        double approximate = 2.34567890;
        ```

    Part 2. According to the code above, the following import statement must be required:
        ```java
        import java.lang.Double;
        ```
