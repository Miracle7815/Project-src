The provided API method `add` is a simple addition method that takes two integer parameters and returns the sum of those integers. Since the method is straightforward and does not have complex logic, the partitioning of equivalence classes for testing can be simplified.

- class:
    1. `x` and `y`: both positive integers
- class:
    1. `x` and `y`: both negative integers
- class:
    1. `x` and `y`: one positive and one negative integer
- class:
    1. `x` and `y`: one integer as zero and the other as a non-zero integer
- class:
    1. `x` and `y`: both zero
- class:
    1. `x` and `y`: large positive integers to test overflow scenarios
- class:
    1. `x` and `y`: large negative integers to test overflow scenarios
